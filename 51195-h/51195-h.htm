<p>In February, 1862, the writer of the following
pages, an officer on the staff of Brigadier-general
Thomas Williams, was stationed at Hatteras. Of all
forlorn stations to which the folly and wickedness
of the Rebellion condemned our officers, Hatteras
was the most forlorn. It blows a gale of wind half
the time. The tide runs through the inlet at the
rate of five miles an hour. It was impossible to unload
the stores for Burnside's expedition during
more than three days of the week. After an easterly
blow&mdash;and there are enough of them&mdash;the waters
are so piled up in the shallow sounds between Hatteras
and the Main, that the tide ebbs without intermission
for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of Hatteras is curious. There can
be little doubt that English navigators penetrated
into those waters long before the Pilgrims landed at
Plymouth. But the colony was not a success. Of
the colonists some returned to England; others died
of want. The present inhabitants of the island are
a sickly, puny race, the descendants of English convicts.
When Great Britain broke up her penal settlement
at the Bermudas, she transported the most
hardened convicts to Van Diemens Land; those who
had been convicted of minor offenses, she turned
loose upon our coast. Here they intermarried; for
the inhabitants of the Main look down upon them as
an inferior race, and will have no social intercourse
with them. The effect of these intermarriages is
seen in the degeneracy of the race.</p>

<p>Until within a few years their principal occupation
was wrecking. Hatteras lies on the direct route of
vessels bound from the West Indies to Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York. The plan adopted by
these guileless natives to aid the storm in insuring
a wreck was simple, but effective. There is a half-wild
pony bred upon the island called "marsh pony."
One of these animals was caught, a leg tied up Rarey
fashion, a lantern slung to his neck, and the ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>mal
driven along the beach on a stormy night. The
effect was that of a vessel riding at anchor. Other
vessels approached, and were soon unpleasantly aware
of the difference between a ship and a marsh pony.</p>

<p>The dwellings bear witness to the occupation of
their owners. The fences are constructed of ships'
knees and planks. In their parlors you may see on
one side a rough board door, on the other an exquisitely
finished rose-wood or mahogany cabin door,
with silver or porcelain knobs. Contrast reigns everywhere.</p>

<p>But the place is not without its attractions to the
botanist. A wild vine, of uncommon strength and
toughness, grows abundantly, and is used in the
place of rope. The iron-tree, hard enough to turn
the edge of the axe, and heavy as the metal from
which it takes its name, is found in abundance, and
the tea-tree, from whose leaves the inhabitants draw
their tea when the season has been a bad one for
wrecks. This tea-tree furnishes the "black drink,"
which the Florida Indians drank to make themselves
invulnerable. They drank it with due religious ceremonies
till it nauseated them, when it was supposed
to have produced the desired effect. What a pity
that we can not associate some such charming super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>stition
with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maladie de mer</i>! It would so comfort
us in our affliction!</p>

<p>But we were not to stay long on this enchanted
isle. Butler had organized his expedition against
New Orleans, and it was now ready to sail. He had
applied for Thomas Williams, who had been strongly
recommended to him by Weitzel, Kenzel, and other
regular officers of his staff. Early in March we received
orders to report to Butler at Fortress Monroe.
We took one of those rolling tubs they call "propellers,"
which did the service between the fortress and
Hatteras for the Quartermaster's Department; and,
after nearly rolling over two or three times, we reached
Old Point. Here we found the immense steamer
the <i>Constitution</i>, loaded with three regiments, ready
to sail. Williams had hoped to have two or three
days to run North and see his wife and children,
whom he had not seen for months. But with him
considerations of duty were before all others. He
thought that three regiments should be commanded
by a brigadier, and he determined to sail at once.
It was a disappointment to us all. To him the loss
was irreparable. He never saw his family again.</p>

<p>It has always appeared to me that General Butler
has not received the credit to which he is entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for the capture of New Orleans. Without him New
Orleans would not have been taken in 1862, and a
blow inflicted upon the Confederacy, which the London
<cite>Times</cite> characterized as the heaviest it had yet
received&mdash;"almost decisive." The writer has no
sympathy with General Butler's extreme views, and
no admiration for his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i>; but he was cognizant
of the New Orleans expedition from its inception,
he accompanied it on the day it set sail, he landed
with it in New Orleans, he remained in that city or
its neighborhood during the whole of Butler's command;
and a sense of justice compels him to say that
Butler originated the expedition, that he carried it
through, under great and unexpected difficulties,
that he brought it to a successful termination, and
that his government of the city at that time, and under
the peculiar circumstances, was simply admirable.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps generally known that it was Butler
who urged this enterprise upon the President.
He was answered that no troops could be spared;
M'Clellan wanted them all for his advance upon
Richmond. Butler thereupon offered to raise the
troops himself, provided the Government would
give him three old regiments. The President consented.
The troops were raised in New England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and three old regiments&mdash;the Fourth Wisconsin,
the Sixth Michigan, and the Twenty-first Indiana&mdash;designated
to accompany them. At the last moment
M'Clellan opposed the departure of the Western
troops, and even applied for the "New England
Division." It was with some difficulty that, appealing
to the President, and reminding him of his
promise, Butler was able to carry out the design for
which the troops had been raised.</p>

<p>We sailed from Old Point on the 6th of March
with the three regiments I have named. We numbered
three thousand souls in all on board. If any
thing were wanting at this day to prove the efficacy
of vaccination, our experience on board that ship
is sufficient. We took from the hospital a man who
had been ill with the small-pox. He was supposed
to be cured. Two days out, his disease broke out
again. The men among whom he lay were packed
as close as herring in a barrel, yet but one took the
disease. They had all been vaccinated within sixty
days. I commend this fact to the attention of those
parish authorities in England who still obstinately
refuse to enforce the Vaccination Act.</p>

<p>Five days brought us, in perfect health, to Ship
Island. Here was another Hatteras, with a milder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
climate, and no "black drink;" a low, sandy island
in the Gulf, off Mobile. This part of the Gulf of
Mexico was discovered and settled by the French.
They landed on Ship Island, and called it "L'Isle
des Chats," from the large number of raccoons they
found there. Not being personally acquainted with
that typical American, they took him for a species of
cat, and named the island accordingly. From Ship
Island and the adjacent coast, which they settled, the
French entered Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain,
and so up the Amite River in their boats.
They dragged their boats across the short distance
which separates the upper waters of the Amite from
the Mississippi, embarked upon the "Father of Waters,"
and sailed down the stream. Here they played
a trick upon John Bull; for, meeting an English
fleet coming up, the first vessels that ever entered
the mouths of the Mississippi, they boarded
them, claimed to be prior discoverers, and averred
that they had left their ships above. There existed
in those days an understanding among maritime
nations that one should not interfere with the prior
discoveries of another. The English thereupon turned,
and the spot, a short distance below New Orleans,
is to this day called "English Turn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>We remained at the "Isle of Cats" about six
weeks&mdash;the life monotonous enough. The beach
offered a great variety of shell-fish, devil-fish, horse-shoes,
and sea-horses. An odd thing was the abundance
of fresh, pure water. Dig a hole two feet
deep anywhere in the sand on that low island, rising
scarcely five feet above the sea, and in two hours
it was filled with fresh water. After using it a
week, it became brackish; when all it was necessary
to do was to dig another hole.</p>

<p>When on Ship Island, I witnessed a curious freak
of lightning. One night we had a terrible thunderstorm,
such as one sees only in those southern latitudes.
In a large circular tent, used as a guard-tent,
eight prisoners were lying asleep, side by side. The
sentry stood leaning against the tent-pole, the butt
of the musket on the ground, the bayonet against
his shoulder. The lightning struck the tent-pole,
leaped to the bayonet, followed down the barrel,
tearing the stock to splinters, but only slightly stunning
the sentry. Thence it passed along the ground,
struck the first prisoner, killing him; passed through
the six inside men without injury to them; and off
by the eighth man, killing him.</p>

<p>Finally, the expedition was complete. Stores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
guns, horses, all had arrived. Butler became impatient
for the action of the navy. He went to the
South-west Pass, where Farragut's fleet was lying,
and urged his advance. Farragut replied that he
had no coal. Butler answered that he would give
him what he wanted, and sent him fifteen hundred
tons. He had had the foresight to ballast his sailing
ships with coal, and so had an ample supply. A
week passed, and still the ships did not ascend the
river. Again Butler went to the Pass, and again
Farragut said that he had not coal enough&mdash;that
once past the forts, he might be detained on the
river, and that it would be madness to make the attempt
unless every ship were filled up with coal.
Once again Butler came to his aid, and gave him
three thousand tons. We were naturally surprised
that so vital an expedition should be neglected by
the Navy Department. The opinion was pretty
general among us that the expedition was not a favorite
with the Department, and that they did not
anticipate any great success from it. They were
quite as surprised as the rest of the world when
Farragut accomplished his great feat.</p>

<p>At length all was ready. The troops were embarked,
and lay off the mouth of the river, waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for the action of the fleet. Farragut, after an idle
bombardment of three days by the mortar-boats,
which he told us he had no confidence in, but which
he submitted to in deference to the opinions of the
Department and of Porter (the firing ceased, by-the-way,
when it had set fire to the wooden barracks in
Fort Jackson, and might have done some good if
continued), burst through the defenses, silenced the
forts, and ascended the river. It is not my province
to describe this remarkable exploit. Its effect
was magical. An exaggerated idea prevailed at that
time of the immense superiority of land batteries
over ships. One gun on shore, it was said, was equal
to a whole ship's battery. The very small results obtained
by the united English and French fleets during
the Crimean war were quoted in proof. Those
magnificent squadrons effected scarcely any thing,
for the capture of Bomarsund was child's play to
them. The English naval officers, proud of their
service and its glorious history, were delighted to
find that, when daringly led, ships could still do
something against land batteries, and all England
rang with Farragut's exploit.</p>

<p>The part played by the army in this affair was minor,
but still important. Our engineer officers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
had assisted in building forts St. Philip and Jackson,
knew the ground well. Under their guidance
we embarked, first in light-draught gun-boats, then
in barges, and made our way through the shallow
waters of the Gulf, and up the bayou, till we landed
at Quarantine, between Fort St. Philip and the city,
cutting off all communication between them. As, in
the stillness of an April evening, we made our slow
way up the bayou amidst a tropical vegetation, festoons
of moss hanging from the trees and drooping
into the water, with the chance of being fired on at
any moment from the dark swamp on either side,
the effect upon the imagination was striking, and the
scene one not easily forgotten.</p>

<p>Farragut had passed up the river, but the forts
still held out, and the great body of the troops was
below them. When, however, they found themselves
cut off from any chance of succor, the men in
Fort St. Philip mutinied, tied their officers to the
guns, and surrendered. Fort Jackson followed the
example. No doubt our turning movement had hastened
their surrender by some days. I once suggested
to Butler that we had hastened it by a week. "A
month, a month, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>It was here they told us that the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
flag had been hauled down from the Mint by a mob
headed by that scoundrel Mumford, and dragged
through the mud. I heard Butler swear by all that
was sacred, that if he caught Mumford, and did not
hang him, might he be hanged himself. He caught
him, and he kept his oath. There never was a wiser
act. It quieted New Orleans like a charm. The
mob, who had assembled at the gallows fully expecting
to hear a pardon read at the last moment, and
prepared to create a riot if he were pardoned, slunk
home like whipped curs.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 1st of May, 1862, the leading
transports anchored off the city. Butler sent for
Williams, and ordered him to land at once. Williams,
like the thorough soldier he was, proposed to
wait till morning, when he would have daylight for
the movement, and when the other transports, with
our most reliable troops, would be up. "No, sir,"
said Butler, "this is the 1st of May, and on this day
we must occupy New Orleans, and the first regiment
to land must be a Massachusetts regiment." So the
orders were issued, and in half an hour the Thirty-first
Massachusetts Volunteers and the Sixth Massachusetts
Battery set foot in New Orleans.</p>

<p>As we commenced our march, Williams saw the
steamer <i>Diana</i> coming up with six companies of the
Fourth Wisconsin. He ordered a halt, and sent me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with instructions for them to land at once, and fall
into the rear of the column. I passed through the
mob without difficulty, gave the orders, and we resumed
our march. The general had directed that
our route should be along the levee, where our right
was protected by the gun-boats. Presently we found
that the head of the column was turning up Julia
Street. Williams sent to know why the change had
been made. The answer came back that Butler was
there, and had given orders to pass in front of the
St. Charles Hotel, while the band played "Yankee
Doodle," and "Picayune Butler's come to Town," if
they knew it. They did not know it, unfortunately,
so we had one unbroken strain of the martial air of
"Yankee Doodle" all the way.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Custom-house late in the evening,
we found the doors closed and locked. Williams
said to me, "What would you do?" "Break the
doors open," I replied. The general, who could not
easily get rid of his old, regular-army habits, ordered
"Sappers and miners to the front." No doubt the
sappers and miners thus invoked would have speedily
appeared had we had any, but two volunteer regiments
and a battery of light artillery were the extent
of our force that night. I turned to the adju<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>tant
of the Fourth Wisconsin, and asked if he had any
axes in his regiment. He at once ordered up two
or three men. We found the weakest-looking door,
and attacked it. As we were battering it in, the major
of the Thirty-first came up, and took an axe from
one of the men. Inserting the edge in the crack
near the lock, he pried it gently, and the door flew
open. I said, "Major, you seem to understand this
sort of thing." He replied, "Oh! this isn't the first
door I have broken open, by a long shot. I was once
foreman of a fire-company in Buffalo."</p>

<p>We entered the building with great caution, for
the report had been spread that it was mined. The
men of the Fourth Wisconsin had candles in their
knapsacks; they always had every thing, those fellows!
We soon found the meter, turned the gas on,
and then proceeded to make ourselves comfortable
for the night. I established myself in the postmaster's
private room&mdash;the Post-office was in the Custom-house&mdash;with
his table for my bed, and a package
of rebel documents for a pillow. I do not remember
what my dreams were that night. We took the
letters from the boxes to preserve them, and piled
them in a corner of my room. They were all subsequently
delivered to their respective addresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Pretty well tired out with the labor and excitement
of the day, I was just making myself tolerably
comfortable for the night, when the officer of the
day reported that a woman urgently desired to see
the general on a matter of life or death. She was
admitted. She told us that her husband was a
Union man, that he had been arrested that day and
committed to the "Calaboose," and that his life was
in danger. The general said to her, "My good woman,
I will see to it in the morning." "Oh, sir," she
replied, "in the morning he will be dead! They
will poison him." We did not believe much in the
poison story, but it was evident that she did. Williams
turned to me, and said, "Captain, have you a
mind to look into this?" Of course I was ready,
and ordering out a company of the Fourth Wisconsin,
and asking Major Boardman, a daring officer
of that regiment, to accompany me, I started for
the Calaboose, guided by the woman. The streets
were utterly deserted. Nothing was heard but the
measured tramp of the troops as we marched along.
Arrived at the Calaboose, I ordered the man I was
in search of to be brought out. I questioned him,
questioned the clerk and the jailer, became satisfied
that he was arrested for political reasons alone, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>dered
his release, and took him with me to the Custom-house,
for he was afraid to return home. Being
on the spot, it occurred to me that it would be as
well to see if there were other political prisoners in
the prison. I had the books brought, and examined
the entries. At last I thought I had discovered another
victim. The entry read, "Committed as a suspicious
character, and for holding communication with
Picayune Butler's troops." I ordered the man before
me. The jailer took down a huge bunch of keys,
and I heard door after door creaking on its hinges.
At last the man was brought out. I think I never
saw a more villainous countenance. I asked him
what he was committed for? He evidently did not
recognize the Federal uniform, but took me for a
Confederate officer, and replied that he was arrested
for talking to "them Lincolnites." I told the jailer
that I did not want that man&mdash;that he might lock
him up again.</p>

<p>Having commenced the search for political prisoners,
I thought it well to make thorough work of it;
so I inquired if there were other prisons in the city.
There was one in the French quarter, nearly two
miles off; so we pursued our weary and solitary
tramp through the city. My men evidently did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
relish it. The prison was quiet, locked up for the
night. We hammered away at the door till we got
the officers up; went in, examined the books, found
no entries of commitments except for crime; put
the officers on their written oaths that no one was
confined there except for crime; and so returned to
our Post-office beds.</p>

<p>The next day was a busy one. Early in the
morning I went to the St. Charles Hotel to make
arrangements for lodging the general and his staff.
With some difficulty I got in. In the rotunda of
that fine building sat about a dozen rebels, looking
as black as a thunder-cloud. I inquired for the
proprietor or clerk in charge, and a young man stepped
forward: "Impossible to accommodate us; hotel
closed; no servants in the house." I said, "At all
events, I will see your rooms." Going into one of
them, he closed the door and whispered, "It would
be as much as my life is worth, sir, to offer to accommodate
you here. I saw a man knifed on Canal
Street yesterday for asking a naval officer the time
of day. But if you choose to send troops and open
the hotel by force, why, we will do our best to make
you comfortable." Returning to the rotunda, I
found Lieutenant Biddle, who had accompanied me&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of the general's aids&mdash;engaged in a hot discussion
with our rebel friends. I asked him "What
use in discussing these matters?" and, turning to the
rebs, with appropriate gesture said, "We've got you,
and we mean to hold you." "That's the talk," they
replied; "we understand <em>that</em>." They told us that
the rebel army was in sight of Washington, and that
John Magruder's guns commanded the Capitol.
Why they picked out Magruder particularly, I can
not say. This news had come by telegraph. We
used to call the rebel telegraphic lines "the grapevine
telegraph," for their telegrams were generally
circulated with the bottle after dinner.</p>

<p>The shop-keepers in New Orleans, when we first
landed there, were generally of the opinion of my
friend the hotel-clerk. A naval officer came to us
one morning at the Custom-house, and said that the
commodore wanted a map of the river; that he had
seen the very thing, but that the shop-keeper refused
to sell it, intimating, however, that if he were compelled
to sell it, why then, of course, he couldn't help
himself. We ordered out a sergeant and ten men.
The officer got his map, and paid for it.</p>

<p>But Butler was not the man to be thwarted in
this way. Finding this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti pris</i> on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the shop-keepers, he issued an order that all shops
must be opened on a certain day, or that he should
put soldiers in, and sell the goods for account "of
whom it might concern." On the day appointed
they were all opened. So, too, with the newspapers.
They refused to print his proclamation. An order
came to us to detail half a dozen printers, and send
them under a staff officer to the office of the <cite>True
Delta</cite>, and print the proclamation. We soon found
the men. From a telegraph-operator to a printer,
bakers, engine-drivers, carpenters, and coopers, we
had representatives of all the trades. This was in
the early days of the war. Afterward the men
were of an inferior class. The proclamation was
printed, and the men then amused themselves by
getting out the paper. Next morning it appeared
as usual; this was enough. The editor soon came
to terms, and the other journals followed suit.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May Butler landed and took quarters
at the St. Charles. There has been much idle
gossip about attempts to assassinate him, and his
fears of it. In regard to the latter, he landed in
New Orleans, and drove a mile to his hotel, with
one staff officer, and one armed orderly only on the
box. When his wife arrived in the city, he rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with one orderly to the levee, and there, surrounded
by the crowd, awaited her landing. As regards the
former, we never heard of any well-authenticated
attempt to assassinate him, and I doubt if any was
ever made.</p>

<p>That afternoon Butler summoned the municipal
authorities before him to treat of the formal surrender
of the city. They came to the St. Charles,
accompanied by Pierre Soulé as their counsel. A
mob collected about the hotel, and became turbulent.
Butler was unprotected, and sent to the
Custom-house for a company of "Massachusetts"
troops. The only Massachusetts troops there were
the Thirty-first, a newly raised regiment. They
afterward became excellent soldiers, but at that time
they were very young and very green. It so happened,
too, that the only company available was
composed of the youngest men of the regiment.
They were ordered out. The officer in charge did
not know the way to the St. Charles. No guide
was at hand, so I volunteered to accompany them.
We drew the troops up on Common Street, and I
entered the hotel to report them to Butler. I found
him engaged in a most animated discussion with
Soulé. Both were able and eloquent men, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Butler undoubtedly got the better of the argument.
Perhaps the fact that he had thirteen thousand bayonets
to back his opinions gave point to his remarks.
Interrupting his discourse for a moment only, he
said, "Draw the men up round the hotel, sir; and
if the mob make the slightest disturbance, fire on
them on the spot," and went on with the discussion.
Returning to the street, I found the mob apostrophizing
my youthful soldiers with, "Does your
mother know you're out?" and like popular wit. It
struck me that the inquiry was well addressed. I
felt disposed to ask the same question. I reported
the matter to Williams, and he thought that it would
be well to counteract the effect. That evening he
sent the band of the Fourth Wisconsin to play in
front of the St. Charles, with the whole regiment,
tall, stalwart fellows, as an escort. In a few minutes
the mob had slunk away. An officer heard one
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</i> say to another, "Those are Western men,
and they say they <em>do</em> fight like h&mdash;&mdash;." One of the
officers told me that his men's fingers itched to fire.</p>

<p>I suppose that all mobs are alike, but certainly the
New Orleans mob was as cowardly as it was brutal.
When we first occupied the Custom-house, they collected
about us, and annoyed our sentries seriously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The orders were to take no notice of what was said,
but to permit no overt act. I was sitting one day in
my office, the general out, when Captain Bailey, the
officer who distinguished himself so much afterward
in building the Red River dam&mdash;and a gallant fellow
he was&mdash;rushed in, and said, "Are we to stand
this?" I said, "What's the matter, Bailey?" He replied
that "One of those d&mdash;&mdash;d scoundrels has taken
his quid from his mouth, and thrown it into the sentry's
face." I said, "No; I don't think that we are
to stand that: that seems to me an 'overt act.' Arrest
him." Bailey rushed out, called to the guard to
follow him, and, jumping into the crowd, seized the
fellow by the collar, and jerked him into the lines.
The guard came up and secured him. The mob fell
back and scattered, and never troubled us from that
day. The fellow went literally down upon his
knees, and begged to be let off. We kept him locked
up that night, and the next day discharged him.
He laid it all to bad whisky.</p>

<p>As the course of this narrative will soon carry the
writer from New Orleans into the interior, he takes
this opportunity to say that he has often been assured
by the rebel inhabitants, men and women of
position and character, that never had New Orleans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
been so well governed, so clean, so orderly, and so
healthy, as it was under Butler. He soon got rid of
the "Plug-uglies" and other ruffian bands: some
he sent to Fort Jackson, and others into the Confederacy.
There was no yellow fever in New Orleans
while we held it, showing as plainly as possible that
its prevalence or its absence is simply a question of
quarantine. (Butler had sworn he would hang the
health officer if the fever got up.) Before we arrived
there, the "back door," as it was called&mdash;the
lake entrance to the city&mdash;was always open, and for
five hundred dollars any vessel could come up. In
1861, when our blockade commenced, and during the
whole of our occupation, yellow fever was unknown.
In 1866 we turned the city over to the civil authorities.
That autumn there were a few straggling
cases, and the following summer the fever was virulent.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut was anxious, after the capture
of New Orleans, to proceed at once against Mobile.
I heard him say that, in the panic excited by the
capture of New Orleans, Mobile would fall an easy
prey. The Government, however, for political as
well as military reasons, was anxious to open the
Mississippi. Farragut was ordered against Vicksburg,
and Williams, with two regiments and a battery,
was sent to accompany and support him.
When one reflects upon the great strength of Vicksburg,
and the immense resources it afterward took
to capture it, it seems rather absurd to have sent us
against it with two regiments and a battery. The
excursion, however, if it is to be looked upon in this
light, was delightful. We had two fine river boats.
The plantations along the banks were in the highest
state of cultivation; the young cane, a few inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
above the ground, of the most lovely green. Indeed,
I know no more beautiful green than that of the
young sugar-cane. Our flag had not been seen in
those parts for over a year, and the joy of the negroes
when they had an opportunity to exhibit it
without fear of their overseers was quite touching.
The river was very high, and as we floated along
we were far above the level of the plantations, and
looked down upon the negroes at work, and into the
open windows of the houses. The effect of this to
one unused to it&mdash;the water above the land&mdash;was
very striking. Natchez, a town beautifully situated
on a high bluff, was gay with the inhabitants who
had turned out to see us. The ladies, with their
silk dresses and bright parasols, and the negro women,
with their gaudy colors, orange especially, which
they affect so much, and which, by-the-way, can be
seen at a greater distance than any other color I
know of.</p>

<p>One often hears of "setting a river on fire," metaphorically
speaking: I have seen it done literally.
The Confederate authorities had issued orders to
burn the cotton along the banks to prevent its falling
into our hands. But as the patriotism of the
owners naturally enough needed stimulating, vigi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>lance
committees were organized, generally of those
planters whose cotton was safe at a distance. These
men preceded us as we ascended the river; and
burned their neighbors' cotton with relentless patriotism.
The burning material was thrown into the
stream, and floated on the surface a long time before
it was extinguished. At night it was a very beautiful
sight to see the apparently flaming water. We
had to exercise some care to steer clear of the burning
masses.</p>

<p>Arrived opposite Vicksburg, we boarded the flag-ship
to consult for combined operations. We found
Farragut holding a council of his captains, considering
the feasibility of passing the batteries of Vicksburg
as he had passed the forts. We apologized for
our intrusion, and were about to withdraw, when he
begged us to stay, and, turning to Williams, he said,
"General, my officers oppose my running by Vicksburg
as impracticable. Only one supports me. So
I must give it up for the present. In ten days they
will all be of my opinion; and then the difficulties
will be much greater than they are now." It turned
out as he had said. In a few days they were nearly
all of his opinion, and he did it.</p>

<p>But we found no dry place for the soles of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
feet. "The water was down," as the Scotchmen
say (down from the hills), and the whole Louisiana
side of the river was flooded. It would have been
madness to land on the Vicksburg side with two
regiments only. Nothing could be done, and we
returned to Baton Rouge, where, finding a healthy
and important position, a United States arsenal, and
Union men who claimed our protection, Williams
determined to remain and await orders.</p>

<p>Here cotton was offered us, delivered on the levee,
at three cents a pound. It was selling at one dollar
in New York. I spoke to Williams about it, and he
said that there was no law against any officer speculating
in cotton or other products of the country (one
was subsequently passed), but that he would not have
any thing to do with it, and advised me not to. I
followed his advice and example. A subsequent
post-commander did not. He made eighty thousand
dollars out of cotton, and then went home and was
made a brigadier-general; I never knew why.</p>

<p>But the Government was determined to open the
river at all hazards. Farragut was re-enforced.
Butler was ordered to send all the troops he could
spare. Davis was ordered down with the Upper
Mississippi fleet. Early in June we started again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for Vicksburg, with six regiments and two batteries.
It was a martial and beautiful sight to see the long
line of gun-boats and transports following each other
in Indian file at regular intervals. Navy and army
boats combined, we numbered about twenty sail&mdash;if
I may apply that word to steamers. On our way
up, the flag-ship, the famous <i>Hartford</i>, was nearly
lost. She grounded on a bank in the middle of the
river, and with a falling stream. Of course there
was the usual talk about a rebel pilot; but no vessel
with the draught of the <i>Hartford</i>, a sloop-of-war, had
ever before ventured to ascend above New Orleans.
The navy worked hard all the afternoon to release
her, but in vain. The hawsers parted like pack-thread.
I was on board when a grizzled quartermaster,
the very type of an old man-of-warsman,
came up to the commodore on the quarter-deck, and,
pulling his forelock, reported that there was a six-inch
hawser in the hold. Farragut ordered it up at
once. Two of our army transports, the most powerful,
were lashed together, the hawser passed round
them, and slackened. They then started with a jerk.
The <i>Hartford</i> set her machinery in motion, the gun-boat
lashed along-side started hers, and the old ship
came off, and was swept down with the current. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
required some seamanship to disentangle all these
vessels.</p>

<p>We found that the waters had subsided since our
last visit to Vicksburg, and so landed at Young's
Point, opposite the town. Some years previously
there had been a dispute between the State authorities
of Louisiana and of Mississippi, and the Legislature
of the former had taken steps to turn the river,
and cut off Vicksburg by digging a canal across the
peninsula opposite. This we knew, and decided to
renew the attempt. We soon found traces of the
engineers' work. The trees were cut down in a
straight line across the Point. Here we set to work.
Troops were sent to the different plantations both
up and down the river, and the negroes pressed into
the service. It was curious to observe the difference
of opinion among the old river captains as to the feasibility
of our plan. Some were sure that the river
would run through the cut; others swore that it
would not, and could not be made to. The matter
was soon settled by the river itself; for it suddenly
rose one night, filled up our ditch, undermined the
banks, and in a few hours destroyed our labor of
days. A somewhat careful observation of the Mississippi
since has satisfied me that if a canal be cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
where the stream impinges upon the bank, it will
take to it as naturally as a duck does to water. But
when the current strikes the opposite bank, as it
does at Young's Point, you can not force it from
its course. Had we attempted our canal some miles
farther up, where the current strikes the right bank,
we should have succeeded. Grant, the next year,
renewed our ditch-digging experiment in the same
place, and with infinitely greater resources, but with
no better success.</p>

<p>Farragut had now made his preparations to run
by the batteries. He divided his squadron into three
divisions, accompanying the second division himself.
The third was under command of Captain Craven, of
the <i>Brooklyn</i>. We stationed Nim's light battery&mdash;and
a good battery it was&mdash;on the point directly opposite
Vicksburg, to assist in silencing the fire of one
of the most powerful of the shore batteries. Very
early in the morning Farragut got under way;
two of his divisions passed, completely silencing the
rebel batteries. The third division did not attempt
the passage. This led to an angry correspondence
between the commodore and Craven, and resulted in
Craven's being relieved, and ordered to report to
Washington. There was a great difference of opin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>ion
among naval officers as to Craven's conduct.
He was as brave an officer as lived. He contended
that it was then broad daylight, that the gunners on
shore had returned to their guns, and that his feeble
squadron would have been exposed to the whole fire
of the enemy, without any adequate object to be
gained in return. Farragut replied that his orders
were to pass, and that he should have done it at all
hazards.</p>

<p>And now an incident occurred which mortified
the commodore deeply. His powerful fleet, re-enforced
by Davis, lay above Vicksburg. The weather
was intensely hot, and the commodore, contrary to
his own judgment, as he told Williams, but on the
urgent request of his officers, had permitted the fires
to be extinguished. Early one morning we had sent
a steamboat with a party up the river to press negroes
into our canal work. Suddenly a powerful
iron-clad, flying the Confederate colors, appeared
coming out of the Yazoo River. There was nothing
for our unarmed little boat to do but to run for
it. The <i>Arkansas</i> opened from her bow-guns, and
the first shell, falling among the men drawn up on
deck, killed the captain of the company, and killed
or wounded ten men. It is so rarely that a shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
commits such havoc, that I mention it as an uncommon
occurrence.</p>

<p>The firing attracted the attention of the fleet, and
they beat to quarters. But there was no time to get
up steam. The <i>Arkansas</i> passed through them all
almost unscathed, receiving and returning their fire.
The shells broke against her iron sides without inflicting
injury. The only hurt she received was
from the <i>Richmond</i>. Alden kept his guns loaded
with powder only, prepared to use shell or shot as
circumstances might require. He loaded with solid
shot, and gave her a broadside as she passed. This
did her some damage, but nothing serious.</p>

<p>In the mean time the alarm was given to the transports.
Farragut had sent us an officer to say that
the <i>Arkansas</i> was coming, that he should stop her if
he could, but that he feared that he could not. The
troops were got under arms, and our two batteries
ordered to the levee. A staff officer said to General
Williams, "General, don't let us be caught here like
rats in a trap; let us attempt something, even if we
fail." "What would you do?" said the general.
"Take the <i>Laurel Hill</i>, put some picked men on
board of her, and let us ram the rebel. We may
not sink her, but we may disable or delay her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
help the gun-boats to capture her." "A good idea,"
said the general; "send for Major Boardman."
Boardman, the daring officer to whom I have before
referred, had been brought up as a midshipman. He
was known in China as the "American devil," from
a wild exploit there in scaling the walls of Canton
one dark night when the gates were closed; climbing
them with the help of his dagger only, making holes
in the masonry for his hands and feet. He was afterward
killed by guerrillas, having become colonel
of his regiment. Boardman came; the <i>Laurel Hill</i>
was cleared; twenty volunteers from the Fourth
Wisconsin were put on board, and steam got up.
The captain refused to go, and another transport
captain was put in command. We should have attempted
something, perhaps failed; but I think one
or other of us would have been sunk. But our preparations
were all in vain. The <i>Arkansas</i> had had
enough of it for that day. She rounded to, and took
refuge under the guns of Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Reporting this incident to Butler subsequently, he
said, "You would have sunk her, sir; you would
have sunk her."</p>

<p>Farragut, as I have said, was deeply mortified.
He gave orders at once to get up steam, and pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>pared
to run the batteries again, determined to destroy
the rebel ram at all hazards. He had resolved
to ram her with the <i>Hartford</i> as she lay under the
guns of Vicksburg. It was with great difficulty he
was dissuaded from doing so, and only upon the
promise of Alden that he would do it for him in the
<i>Richmond</i>. Farragut, in his impulsive way, seized
Alden's hand, "Will you do this for me, Alden?
will you do it?" The rapidity of the current, the
unusual darkness of the night, and the absence of
lights on the <i>Arkansas</i> and on shore, prevented the
execution of the plan. To finish with the <i>Arkansas</i>,
she afterward came down the river to assist in the
attack on Baton Rouge. Part of her machinery gave
out; she turned and attempted to return to Vicksburg,
was pursued by our gun-boats, run ashore,
abandoned, and burned.</p>

<p>The rebels never had any luck with their gun-boats.
They always came to grief. They were
badly built, badly manned, or badly commanded.
The <i>Louisiana</i>, the <i>Arkansas</i>, the <i>Manassas</i>, the
<i>Tennessee</i>, the <i>Albemarle</i>&mdash;great things were expected
of them all, and they did nothing.</p>

<p>But we were as far from the capture of Vicksburg
as ever. Fever attacked our men in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fatal swamps, and they became thoroughly discouraged.
The sick-list was fearful. Of a battery of
eighty men, twenty only were fit for duty. The
Western troops, and they were our best, were homesick.
Lying upon the banks of the Mississippi,
with transports above Vicksburg convenient for
embarkation, they longed for home. The colonels
came to Williams, and suggested a retreat <em>up</em> the
river, to join Halleck's command. Williams held a
council of war. He asked me to attend it. The
colonels gave their opinions, some in favor of, and
others against, the proposed retreat. When it came
to my turn, I spoke strongly against it. I urged
that we had no <em>right</em> to abandon our comrades at
New Orleans; that it might lead to the recapture
of that city; that if our transports were destroyed,
we should at least attempt to get back by land. I
do not suppose that Williams ever entertained the
least idea of retreating up the river, but thought it
due to his officers to hear what they had to say in
favor of it. The plan was abandoned.</p>

<p>Of the events which immediately followed the
council of war referred to in the last chapter, the
writer knows only by report. He was prostrated
with fever, taken to a house on shore, moved back
to head-quarters boat, put on board a gun-boat,
and sent to New Orleans. Farragut, with his usual
kindness, offered to take him on board the <i>Hartford</i>,
give him the fleet-captain's cabin, and have the fleet-surgeon
attend him. But Williams declined the
offer. Farragut then offered to send him to New
Orleans in a gun-boat. This Williams accepted.
The writer was taken to New Orleans, sent to military
hospital, an assistant-surgeon's room given up
to him, and every care lavished upon him; for one
of Williams's staff&mdash;poor De Kay&mdash;wounded in a
skirmish, had died in hospital. Butler had con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>ceived
the idea&mdash;erroneous, I am sure&mdash;that he had
been neglected by the surgeons. When I was
brought down he sent them word that if another of
Williams's staff died there, they would hear from
him. I did not die.</p>

<p>Meantime, unable to effect any thing against
Vicksburg, with more than half his men on the sick-list,
Williams returned to Baton Rouge. The rebel
authorities, with spies everywhere, heard of the condition
of our forces, and determined to attack them.
Early one foggy morning twelve thousand men, under
Breckenridge, attacked our three or four thousand
men fit for duty. But they did not catch
Williams napping. He had heard of the intended
movement, and was prepared to meet it. Our forces
increased, too, like magic. Sick men in hospital,
who thought that they could not stir hand or foot,
found themselves wonderfully better the moment
there was a prospect of a fight. Happily a thick
mist prevailed. Happily, too, they first attacked
the Twenty-first Indiana, one of our stanchest regiments,
holding the centre of the position. This fine
regiment was armed with breech-loaders, the only
ones in the Gulf. Lying on the ground, they could
see the legs of the rebels below the mist, and fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with a steady aim upon them, themselves unseen.
On the right the Thirtieth Massachusetts was engaged,
but not hotly. The left was but slightly
pressed. Williams had carefully reconnoitred the
ground the afternoon before, and marked out his
different positions. As the battle progressed, he fell
back upon his second position, contracting his lines.
As it grew hotter, he issued orders to fall back upon
the third position. As he gave the order, the lieutenant-colonel
of the Twenty-first, Colonel Keith, as
plucky a little fellow as lived, came to him and said,
"For God's sake, general, don't order us to fall back!
We'll hold this position against the whole d&mdash;d rebel
army." "Do your men feel that way, colonel?" replied
Williams; and turning to the regiment, he said,
"Fix bayonets!" As he uttered these words, he was
shot through the heart. The men fixed bayonets,
charged, and the rebels gave way. But there was
no one competent to take command. The Fourth
Wisconsin, on our left, waited in vain for the orders
Williams had promised them, eager to advance, for
he had meant that this regiment should take the
rebels in flank. The victory was won, but its fruits
were not gathered.</p>

<p>I think that grander words were never uttered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a commander on the field of battle as he received
his death-wound than these words of Williams's.
"Fix bayonets!" means business, and in this instance
they meant victory.</p>

<p>Thomas Williams was a noble fellow. Had he
lived, he would have been one of the great generals
of our war. Butler told the writer that, had Williams
survived Baton Rouge, it was his intention to
have turned over the whole military command to
him, and confined himself to civil matters. The
"General Order" he issued on Williams's death is a
model of classic and pathetic English. It is quoted
as such by Richard Grant White in his "Miscellany."
I give it entire, for it can not be too widely
circulated, both on account of its style and its subject.</p>

<p>Williams was an original thinker. He had some
rather striking ideas about the male portion of the
human race. He held that all men were by nature
cruel, barbarous, and coarse, and were only kept in
order by the influence of women&mdash;their wives, mothers,
and sisters. "Look at those men," he would
say. "At home they are respectable, law-abiding
citizens. It's the women who make them so. Here
they rob hen-roosts, and do things they would be
ashamed to do at home. There is but one thing
will take the place of their women's influence, and
that is discipline; and I'll give them enough of it."
I used to think his views greatly exaggerated, but I
came to be very much of his opinion before the war
was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>A curious thing happened to his body. It was
sent down in a transport with wounded soldiers.
She came in collision with the gun-boat <i>Oneida</i> coming
up, and was sunk. Various accounts were given
of the collision. It was of course reported that the
rebel pilot of the transport had intentionally run
into the gun-boat. I think this improbable, for I
have observed that rebel pilots value their lives as
much as other people. Captain (afterward Admiral)
Lee lay by the wreck, and picked up the wounded:
none were lost. Shortly afterward Gun-boat No. 1,
commanded by Crosby, a great friend of Williams,
came up. Lee transferred the men to her, ordered
her to New Orleans, and himself proceeded to Baton
Rouge. Crosby heard that Williams's body
was on board. He spent several hours in searching
for it, but without success. He reluctantly concluded
to abandon the search. Some hours later
in the day, and several miles from the scene of the
disaster, a piece of the wreck was seen floating
down the current, with a box upon it. A boat was
lowered, and the box was picked up. It turned out
to be the coffin containing the body. His portmanteau
too floated ashore, fell into honest hands, and
was returned to me by a gentleman of the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been General Butler's intention, on my recovery,
to give me command of the Second Louisiana,
a regiment he was raising in New Orleans, mostly
from disbanded and rebel soldiers. My recovery
was so long delayed, however, that he was compelled
to fill the vacancy otherwise. Shortly afterward
General T. W. Sherman was ordered to New Orleans,
and I was assigned to duty on his staff. He
was sent to Carondelet to take charge of the post
at the Parapet, and of all the northern approaches
to New Orleans. This was done under orders from
Washington; but of this Sherman was not aware, for
no copy of the orders had been sent him. He never
knew to what an important command it was the intention
of the Government to assign him till some
years later, when the writer, having become Adjutant-general
of the Department of the Gulf, found
the orders in the archives of the Department.</p>

<p>But the days of Butler's command were brought
to a close. Banks arrived with re-enforcements, and
exhibited his orders to take command of the Department.
No one was more surprised than Butler.
He had supposed that Banks's expedition was directed
against Texas. His recall seemed ungrateful on
the part of the Government, for it was to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the capture of New Orleans at that early date was
principally due. It is probable that the consuls in
that city had complained of him, and our Government,
thinking it all-important to give no cause of
complaint to foreign governments, Great Britain and
France especially, recalled him.</p>

<p>As General Butler will not again appear in these
pages, I can not close this part of my narrative without
endeavoring to do him justice in regard to one
or two points on which he has been attacked. The
silver-spoon story is simply absurd. Butler confiscated
and used certain table-silver. When Banks relieved
him, he turned it over to him. When a howl
was made about it toward the close of the war, and
the Government referred the papers to Butler, for a
report, he simply forwarded a copy of Banks's quartermaster's
receipt. I was amused once at hearing
that inimitable lecturer, Artemus Ward, get off a joke
upon this subject in New Orleans. He was describing
the Mormons, and a tea-party at Brigham Young's,
and said that Brigham Young probably had a larger
tea-service than any one in the world, "except," said
he, and then paused as if to reflect&mdash;"except, perhaps,
General Butler." Imagine the effect upon a
New Orleans audience. It is perhaps needless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
observe that Butler was not at that time in command.</p>

<p>The only charge against Butler which was never
thoroughly disproved was that he permitted those
about him to speculate, to the neglect of their duties
and to the injury of our cause and good name. He
must have been aware of these speculations, and
have shut his eyes to them. But that he himself
profited pecuniarily by them, I do not believe.</p>

<p>The famous General Orders, No. 10, "The Woman's
Order," was issued while I was in New Orleans,
and excited much and unfavorable comment. Butler
ordered that ladies insulting United States officers
should be treated "as women of the town plying
their trade." Strong, his adjutant-general, remonstrated,
and begged him to alter it. He said that
he meant simply that they should be arrested and
punished according to the municipal law of the city,
<em>i.e.</em>, confined for one night and fined five dollars.
Strong replied, "Why not say so, then?" But Butler
has much of the vanity of authorship. He was
pleased with the turn of the phrase, thought it happy,
and refused to surrender it.</p>

<p>In this connection, when in London, I heard an
anecdote of Mr. Adams and Lord Palmerston which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
is not generally known. It was not often that any
one got the better of old "Pam," but Mr. Adams
did. When Butler's order reached England, Lord
Palmerston was the head of the Government; Lord
John Russell was Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs. Lord Palmerston wrote to Mr. Adams to
know if the order as printed in the London papers
was authentic. Mr. Adams asked if he inquired officially
or privately. Lord Palmerston replied rather
evasively. Mr. Adams insisted. Lord Palmerston
answered that if Mr. Adams must know, he
begged him to understand that he inquired officially.
Mr. Adams had the correspondence carefully copied
in Moran's best handwriting, and inclosed it to
Lord John with a note inquiring, who was Her
Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; was
it Lord Palmerston, or was it Lord John? A quick
reply came from Lord John, asking him to do nothing
further in the matter till he heard from him
again. The next day a note was received from
Lord Palmerston withdrawing the correspondence.</p>

<p>I have given two specimens of Butler's style.
Here is another, and of a different character. At
the request of a naval officer in high command, Farragut
applied to Butler for steamboats to tow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mortar vessels to Vicksburg. Butler replied that
he regretted that he had none to spare. The officer
answered that if Butler would prevent his
brother from sending quinine and other contraband
stores into the Confederacy, there would be boats
enough. This came to Butler's ears. He answered.
After giving a list of his boats, and stating their different
employments, he proceeded substantially as
follows. I quote from memory. "Now, there are
two kinds of lying. The first is when a man deliberately
states what he knows to be false. The second
is when he states what is really false, but what
at the time he believes to be true. For instance,
when Captain &mdash;&mdash; reports that the ram <i>Louisiana</i>
came down upon his gun-boats, and a desperate
fight ensued, he stated what is in point of fact false;
for the <i>Louisiana</i> was blown up and abandoned,
and was drifting with the current, as is proved by
the report of the rebel commander, Duncan: but
Captain &mdash;&mdash; believed it to be true, and acted accordingly;
for he retreated to the mouth of the
river, leaving the transports to their fate."</p>

<p>The autumn of 1862 passed without any special
incident. Sherman rebuilt the levees near Carrollton,
repaired and shortened the Parapet, pushed his
forces to the north, and occupied and fortified Manchac
Pass. All these works were constructed by
Captain Bailey, to whom I have already alluded,
and of whom I shall have much to say hereafter;
for he played a most important and conspicuous part
in the Louisiana campaigns. At Manchac he constructed
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i> of a work built of mud and clamshells.
He had the most remarkable faculty of making
the negroes work. I have seen the old inhabitants
of the coast (French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">côte</i>, bank of the river)
stopping to gaze with surprise at the "niggers"
trundling their wheelbarrows filled with earth on the
double-quick. Such a sight was never before seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in Louisiana, and probably never will be again.
Sherman was the first officer, too, to enroll the
blacks, set them to work, and pay them wages. He
was no <em>professed</em> friend of the negro, but he did
more practically for their welfare to make them useful,
and save them from vagabondage, than Phelps
or any other violent abolitionist, who said that the
slaves had done enough work in their day, and so
left them in idleness, and fed them at their own
tables. Every negro who came within our lines&mdash;and
there were hundreds of them&mdash;was enrolled
on the quartermaster's books, clothed, fed, and paid
wages, the price of his clothing being deducted.
The men worked well. They were proud of being
paid like white men.</p>

<p>Later in the season, Sherman sent out successful
expeditions into the enemy's territory. One to Ponchitoula
destroyed a quantity of rebel government
stores; another, across Lake Pontchartrain, captured
a valuable steamer. Sherman employed an admirable
spy, the best in the Department. As a rule, both
Butler's and Banks's spies were a poor lot, constantly
getting up cock-and-bull stories to magnify their
own importance, and thus misled their employers.
Sherman's spy was a woman. Her information al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ways
turned out to be reliable, and, what is perhaps
a little remarkable, was never exaggerated.</p>

<p>Butler had now left the Department, and Banks
was in command. About this time Holly Springs
was occupied by Van Dorn, and our dépôts burned,
Grant falling back. The attack upon Vicksburg, too,
from the Yazoo River had failed. Banks's spies exaggerated
these checks greatly, and reported that the
enemy was in full march upon New Orleans. There
was something of a stampede among us. A new
command was created, called the "Defenses of New
Orleans," and given to Sherman. In a fortnight the
face of these defenses was vastly changed. When
he took command, the city was undefended to the
east and south. In a few days the rebel works were
rebuilt, guns mounted, light batteries stationed near
the works, each supported by a regiment of infantry.
New Orleans, with our gun-boats holding the river
and lake, was impregnable.</p>

<p>No commanding officer in our army was more
thorough in his work than Sherman. I remember
an instance of this in an exchange of prisoners which
took place under his orders. The arrangements
were admirable. We were notified that a schooner
with United States soldiers on board lay at Lakeport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
on Lake Pontchartrain. Within an hour of receiving
the report I was on my way to effect the exchange.
I was accompanied by our quartermaster, to insure
prompt transportation to New Orleans; by our commissary,
to see that the men were fed, for our prisoners
were always brought in with very insufficient
supplies, the rebel officers assuring us that they had
not food to give them; and by our surgeon, to give
immediate medical assistance to those requiring it.
Sherman told me to give the rebel officers in charge
a breakfast or dinner, and offered to pay his share.
We reached Lakeport about sunset. I went on
board at once, and made arrangements for the exchange
at six o'clock in the morning. I inquired of
the men if they had had any thing to eat. "Nothing
since morning." The officer in charge explained
that they had been delayed by head-winds; but they
were always delayed by head-winds. We sent food
on board that night. At six in the morning the
schooner was warped along-side of the pier. A train
was run down, a line of sentries posted across the
pier, and no stranger permitted to approach. The
roll was called, and as each man answered to his
name, he stepped ashore and entered the train.
Meantime I had ordered down a breakfast from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
famous French restaurant at Lakeport; and while
the necessary arrangements were being completed by
the quartermaster, we gave the Confederate officers
a breakfast. It was easy to see, from the manner
in which they attacked it, that they did not fare so
sumptuously every day. Colonel Szymanski, who
commanded, an intelligent and gentlemanly officer,
asked permission to buy the remnants from the restaurant
for lunch and dinner on the return voyage.
The train was now ready, the schooner set sail, and
we started for New Orleans. On our arrival, we
bought out a baker's shop and one or two orange-women.
It was a long time since the prisoners had
tasted white bread. They formed, and marched to
the barracks. Before noon that day they were in
comfortable quarters, and seated at a bountiful dinner,
prepared in advance for them. This was Sherman's
organization. I had an opportunity to contrast
it, not long after, with an exchange effected under
direct orders from head-quarters. The contrast
was not in Banks's favor.</p>

<p>On this occasion I had gone down as a spectator,
and to see if I could be of use. I was going on
board the cartel, when I was stopped by a lady who
asked me to take a young girl on board to see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
brother. Of course I was compelled to refuse. She
then asked if I would not tell her brother that she
was on the end of the pier, that they might at least
see each other. This I promised to do. On board
I found a number of sailors, part of the crew of the
<i>Mississippi</i>, which had been recently lost at Port
Hudson. As usual, they had had nothing to eat
since the previous evening.</p>

<p>Before leaving the vessel, I inquired for Lieutenant
Adams. They told me that he was in "that
boat," pointing to one, having pulled ashore, hoping
to see his sister. As I approached the shore I met
his boat returning; I stopped it, and asked him if he
had seen his sister. He had not. I told him to get
in with me, and I would take him to her. He did
so, and I pulled to within a few yards of the spot
where she was standing. Scarcely a word passed
between them, for both were sobbing. We remained
there about three minutes, and then pulled back.
We were all touched, officers and men, by this little
display of the home affections in the midst of war.
I think it did us all good.</p>

<p>General Banks was not pleased when he heard of
this incident. Perhaps it was reported to him incorrectly.
But Sherman thought that I had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
right. I always found that our regular officers
were more anxious to soften the rigors of war, and
to avoid all unnecessary severity, than our volunteers.
On our march through Louisiana under Franklin, a
strong provost guard preceded the column, whose
duty it was to protect persons and property from
stragglers till the army had passed. If planters in
the neighborhood applied for a guard, it was always
furnished. On one occasion such a guard was captured
by guerrillas. General Franklin wrote at once
to General Taylor, protesting against the capture of
these men as contrary to all the laws of civilized
warfare. Taylor promptly released them, and sent
them back to our lines. General Lee did the same
in Virginia.</p>

<p>And so the winter wore through, and the spring
came. Banks made a successful expedition to Alexandria,
winning the battle of Irish Bend. I am the
more particular to record this, as his reputation as a
commander rests rather upon his success in retreat
than in advance. And the month of May found us
before Port Hudson.</p>

<p>Vicksburg is situated eight hundred miles above
New Orleans. In all this distance there are but five
commanding positions, and all these on the left or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
east bank of the river. It was very important to
the rebels to fortify a point below the mouth of the
Red River, in order that their boats might bring
forward the immense supplies furnished by Louisiana,
Texas, and Arkansas. They selected Port Hudson,
a miserable little village not far below the Red
River, and fortified it strongly. Sherman had seen
the importance of attacking this place when the
works were commenced, but Butler told him, very
truly, that he had not troops enough in the Department
to justify the attempt.</p>

<p>I think that it was the 24th of May when we
closed in upon Port Hudson. Sherman's command
held the left. He had a front of three miles, entirely
too much for one division. The country
was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</i> to us, and we had to feel our
way. Of course there was much reconnoitring to
be done&mdash;exciting and interesting work&mdash;but not
particularly safe or comfortable. Sherman did
much of this himself. He had a pleasant way of
riding up in full sight of the enemy's batteries, accompanied
by his staff. Here he held us while he
criticised the manner in which the enemy got his
guns ready to open on us. Presently a shell would
whiz over our heads, followed by another somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nearer. Sherman would then quietly remark, "They
are getting the range now: you had better scatter."
As a rule we did not wait for a second order.</p>

<p>I remember his sending out a party one day to
reconnoitre to our extreme left, and connect with
the fleet, which lay below Port Hudson. We knew
it was somewhere there; but how far off it lay, or
what was the character of the country between us,
we did not know. A company of cavalry reconnoitring
in the morning had been driven in. Sherman
determined to make a reconnoissance in force. He
sent out the cavalry again, and supported it with a
regiment of infantry. I asked permission to accompany
them. He gave it, and added, "By-the-way,
captain, when you are over there, just ride up and
draw their fire, and see where their guns are. They
won't hit you." I rode up and drew their fire, and
they did not hit me; but I don't recommend the
experiment to any of my friends.</p>

<p>This reconnoissance was successful. We passed
through a thickly wooded country, intersected by
small streams, for about two miles, when we emerged
upon the open in full view of the works of Port
Hudson. This we had to cross, exposed to their
fire. We thus gained the road, running along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
top of the bluff; and, following this, we came in
view of the fleet. Our arrival produced a sensation.
They had been looking out for us for two or three
days. The men swarmed up the rigging and on to
the yards. Fifty telescopes were leveled at us; and
as we galloped down the bluff and along the levee to
the ships, cheer after cheer went up from the fleet.
We went on board the nearest gun-boat, and got
some bread-and-cheese and Bass&mdash;which tasted remarkably
good, by-the-way. I staid but a little
while, for I was anxious about my men. On our
homeward march the enemy opened on us, and we
lost two or three men. I felt saddened at the loss
of any men while in some measure under my command,
and reported this loss first to the general. I
was much comforted when he replied, "Lose men!
of course you lost men. Reconnoissances in force
always lose men!"</p>

<p>A few weeks previous to my visit to the fleet,
Farragut had attempted to run by Port Hudson,
with a view to communicate with Porter at Vicksburg,
but more especially to blockade the mouth of
the Red River. This, though the least known of his
great exploits, was probably the most perilous and
the least successful. But two vessels passed the bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>teries&mdash;his
own, the old <i>Hartford</i>, as a matter of
course, and the gun-boat that was lashed to her.
Several were driven back disabled, and that fine
ship, the <i>Mississippi</i>, got aground and was lost.
The <i>Hartford</i> and her consort, however, did good
service, preventing all rebel vessels from showing
themselves upon the river between Port Hudson
and Vicksburg.</p>

<p>While on board the gun-boat, I remarked to her
captain that I was surprised that General Banks did
not make his assault upon our left, where we could
have the aid of the fleet, instead of on the right, as he
evidently proposed to do. The remark was repeated
to Farragut, who mentioned it to Banks. A day
or two after the failure of our assault of the 27th of
May, I was surprised by a summons to head-quarters,
and still more surprised when I was asked what
was my plan for taking Port Hudson. My plan was
simply to utilize our powerful fleet instead of ignoring
it. Sherman, who, after his recovery from his
wound received a few days later, visited the place
after its fall, and carefully examined the ground,
told me that the assault should undoubtedly have
been made on our left, not only on account of the
fleet, but on account of the character of the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
We afterward erected batteries here within a very
short distance of the enemy's, and commanding
them; and we dug up to their very citadel. Had
another assault been ordered, as it seemed at one
time probable, it would have been made here, and
would probably have been a repetition, on a small
scale, of the affair of the Malakoff. There was another
advantage on this flank. Had we effected
a lodgment even with a small force, we could have
maintained our position in the angle between the
parapet and the river until re-enforcements reached
us. At the points selected for the assault of the
27th of May&mdash;had we succeeded in getting in&mdash;we
should have found ourselves exposed to attacks in
front and on both flanks, and should probably have
been driven out again.</p>

<p>The siege of Port Hudson was tedious and bloody.
Banks ordered an assault. It was made, and resulted
in a miserable repulse. He was asked why assault
when the place must inevitably be starved out
in a few weeks. He replied, "The people of the
North demand blood, sir." Sherman led the assault
in person, at the head of the Sixth Michigan regiment;
Bailey headed the negroes, with plank and
other materials to fill up the fosse. I had heard be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>fore
of negroes turning white from fright, and did
not believe it; but it is literally true. The men advanced
within a few yards of the works, but could
effect no lodgment. There never was a more useless
waste of life. Sherman lost his leg, and his horse
was killed under him; one staff officer and his horse
were killed; an orderly was killed; another staff
officer was wounded, and his horse killed; and another
orderly had his horse killed. This is a pretty
bloody ten minutes' work for a general and his staff.</p>

<p>The staff officer who was wounded was Badeau,
our consul-general at London, and author of that
model military history, the first volume of the "Life
of Grant."</p>

<p>Fortunately, probably, for me, I had been sent
with orders to Sherman's other brigade, to support
the attack by an assault on the left. It was hot
enough where I was. The shells shrieked over my
head, and a round shot rolled playfully between my
horse's legs. But it was nothing like the "hell of
fire" to which Sherman was exposed.</p>

<p>Sherman having been sent to New Orleans, to hospital,
General William Dwight took command of the
division. After a while another assault was made:
it was as fruitless as the first. But the enemy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
now getting short of provisions. They lived mostly
on Indian corn. Many deserters came to us, mostly
Louisianians, for the "Wrackensackers" (Arkansas
men) and the Texans rarely deserted. These made
up the garrison. They reported great want in the
place; and, what was far better proof&mdash;for it will
not do to trust implicitly to deserters' stories&mdash;their
gums showed the want of proper food. The end
was approaching. On the 4th of July Vicksburg
surrendered. Our outposts communicated this intelligence
to the rebel outposts, and chaffed them about
it. The news was reported to Gardiner. He sent a
flag to Banks to inquire if it were true. Banks replied
that it was, and Port Hudson surrendered.</p>

<p>It was curious to observe the sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i>
which the soldiers on both sides established
during the siege. When they were tired of trying
to pick each other off through the loop-holes, one of
them would tie a white handkerchief to his bayonet,
and wave it above the parapet. Pretty soon a handkerchief,
or its equivalent&mdash;for the rebs did not indulge
in useless luxuries&mdash;would be seen waving on
the other side. This meant truce. In a moment
the men would swarm out on both sides, sitting with
their legs dangling over the parapet, chaffing each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
other, and sometimes with pretty rough wit. They
were as safe as if a regular flag were out. No man
dared to violate this tacit truce. If he had done so,
his own comrades would have dealt roughly with
him. After a while, on one side or the other, some
one would cry out, "Get under cover now, Johnnie,"
or "Look out now, Yank; we are going to fire," and
the fire would recommence.</p>

<p>Active military operations were now suspended,
and I obtained leave of absence. But it was revoked;
for General William B. Franklin had arrived
in the Department, and I was assigned to his
staff. I naturally felt disappointed at losing my
leave, but I was subsequently glad that it had so
happened; for it led to my promotion, and to the
establishment of friendly and pleasant relations
which have survived the war.</p>

<p>Early in the fall of 1863, Major-general Franklin
was put in command of the military part of an expedition
which had been planned against Sabine Pass,
on the coast of Texas. The arrangement was for
the navy to enter the port at night, get in the rear
of the work, and capture it; whereupon the troops
were to land, garrison the place, and hold it as a base
for future operations in Texas. The plan failed.
The expected signals were not displayed. The gun-boats
made the attempt in broad daylight, got
aground in the shallow and winding channel, and
were captured. Many of the sailors jumped overboard,
swam ashore, ran down through the marsh,
and were picked up by our boats. The plan had
failed, and there was nothing for the troops to do
but to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>That night we had a collision between one of our
large sea-going steamers and our light river boat
used for head-quarters. Our side was apparently
smashed in. A panic seized the crew; captain, pilot,
engineer, hands, all rushed for the steamer. Most
of our head-quarters company and officers followed
the example. I was reading in the cabin when
the collision occurred. The crash and the cries attracted
my attention. I went upon deck, and tried
for a moment to restore order, but in vain. The
soldiers on the steamer shouted, "Come on board!
come on board! You're sinking! there's a great
hole in your side!" The waves dashed our little
boat against the sides of the steamer, and the light
plank of the wheel-house was grinding and crashing.
I can easily understand how contagious is a panic.
It was with a great effort I could restrain myself
from following the example set me. I knew, however,
that my place was with the general, and I went
in search of him. I found him on the hurricane-deck,
seated on the sky-light, quietly smoking his
cigar. I said, "General, are you not going to leave
her?" "I don't believe she'll sink," he replied.
"But she is an abandoned ship, sir; every one has
left her." "Have they? are you sure?" "I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
make sure," I replied; and, going to the wheel-house,
found it deserted. Then I looked into the engine-room&mdash;I
remember the engine looked so grim and
stiff in its solitude. Franklin then consented to go.
We found a quiet place aft where there was no confusion;
and as the waves tossed up our light vessel
to a level with the steamer, he sprung upon her
deck. As soon as he had jumped, I attempted to
follow, but the vessel was not tossed high enough.
So I watched my chance, and plunged head foremost
into a port-hole, where friendly hands caught me,
and prevented my falling on the deck.</p>

<p>But our little steamer would not sink. Franklin
at once ordered out the boats, secured the captain
and crew, and returned on board. We found that
the outer shell of the boat was crushed in, and that
she was leaking badly; but the inner ceiling was
unhurt. We easily kept her free with the pumps
until we had repaired damages. I do not think that
the general ever quite forgave me for persuading
him to leave her.</p>

<p>As we had failed by sea, we next tried the land,
and with better success. We marched to Opelousas,
driving the rebels before us. A pleasant incident
happened on this march, one of those trifles which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
soften the horrors of war. I had known at New
Orleans a charming rebel creole whose husband was
a general in the Confederate army. I had had an
opportunity to render the family some trifling service.
One day we intercepted a courier bearing a
letter from General &mdash;&mdash; to General Miles, commanding
the district. He wrote that he had fallen
upon the rear of our column and picked up a number
of stragglers, and that he should send them next
day to head-quarters. Of course we laid our plans,
captured the escort, and recaptured our own men.
With the general's assent, I sent the letter to the
lady in question, with a line to the effect that she
probably had not seen her husband's handwriting
for some time, and might be gratified to learn from
the inclosed letter that he was well. She would regret
to learn, however, that our men had been retaken
and the escort captured; that I should spare no
pains to capture the general himself, and send him
to his wife; and that if he knew what fate was in
store for him, I was sure that he would make but a
feeble resistance. She replied in the same spirit,
that with such generous enemies war lost half its
terrors.</p>

<p>Under Franklin nothing was left undone that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
could properly be done to soften the rigors of war
to non-combatants. Often have his staff officers
spent weary hours over intercepted correspondence.
It was our duty to examine the correspondence in
search of intelligence that might be useful to us; but
it was no part of our duty carefully to reseal those
letters which were purely on domestic or personal
matters, re-inclose the hundred odd little souvenirs
they contained, and send them under a flag to the
rebel lines. And yet we did this repeatedly. I
wonder if the rebels ever did as much for us anywhere
in the Confederacy!</p>

<p>Speaking of intercepted letters, I remember that
at New Orleans we once seized a bag as it was about
to cross the lake. Among other letters, it contained
one from a young lady to her brother-in-law in Mobile.
I have rarely seen a cleverer production. She
gave an account, with great glee, of a trick she had
played upon a Boston newspaper, perhaps the "Respectable
Daily." She wrote that she had sent them
a poem called "The Gypsy's Wassail," the original
in Sanscrit, the translation of course in English, and
all that was patriotic and loyal. "Now, the Sanscrit,"
she wrote, "was English written backward,
and read as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"'God bless our brave Confederates, Lord!</p>
<p class="verse">Lee, Johnson, Smith, and Beauregard!</p>
<p class="verse">Help Jackson, Smith, and Johnson Joe,</p>
<p class="verse">To give them fits in Dixie, oh!'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Boston newspaper fell into the trap, and
published this "beautiful and patriotic poem, by our
talented contributor." But in a few days some sharp
fellow found out the trick and exposed it.</p>

<p>The letter was signed "Anna" simply, and no
clue to the author was given. Anna thought that
she was safe. She forgot that in the same bag was
a letter from her sister to her husband, with signature
and address, in which she said, "Anna writes
you one of her amusing letters." So I had discovered
who Miss Anna was, and wrote her accordingly.
I told her that her letter had fallen into the hands of
one of those "Yankee" officers whom she saw fit to
abuse, and who was so pleased with its wit that he
should take great pleasure in forwarding it to its
destination; that in return he had only to ask that
when the author of "The Gypsy's Wassail" favored
the expectant world with another poem, he might be
honored with an early copy. Anna must have been
rather surprised.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, there were constant trials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wit between the rebels and ourselves, in which we
sometimes came off second best. But they had their
women to help them, which gave them an immense
advantage, for in such matters one woman is worth
a "wilderness" of men. I recollect one day we sent
a steamboat full of rebel officers, exchanged prisoners,
into the Confederacy. They were generally accompanied
by their wives and children. Our officers
noticed the most extraordinary number of dolls on
board&mdash;every child had a doll&mdash;but they had no suspicions.
A lady told me afterward that every doll
was filled with quinine. The sawdust was taken out
and quinine substituted. Depend upon it that female
wit devised that trick.</p>

<p>They attacked us in poetry too, generally written
by young ladies, and some of it decidedly clever.
Strong, Butler's adjutant-general, had stopped the
service in one of the Episcopal churches, because the
clergyman prayed for Jeff Davis instead of for the
"President of the United States." This furnished
a theme for some bitter stanzas. Banks had sent a
light battery to drive among a crowd of women and
children collected on the levee to see their friends
off, and disperse them. This furnished a fruitful
theme for the rebel muse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to our Opelousas campaign.</p>

<p>We followed the course of the Teche for several
days through a lovely country, the "Garden of
Louisiana," and it deserves its name. The names in
this part of the country are French. I remember
we had a skirmish at a place called "Carrion-crow
Bayou." It struck me as an odd name to give
to a stream. I made inquiries, and found that a
Frenchman had settled upon its banks, named Carran
Cro.</p>

<p>Our march to Opelousas was without striking incident.
The Confederates once or twice came into
position, as if to dispute our progress, but they always
gave way. Our return, however, was more
eventful. The rebels attacked an outlying brigade,
and caught it napping. It occupied a strong position,
and could easily have beaten cavalry off, the
only force by which it was attacked. Two regiments,
however, were seized with a panic, and surrendered
without firing a shot. The alarm was given to the
main body, and re-enforcements quickly arrived, and
drove off the rebels; but they carried off many prisoners.
Not long afterward we turned the tables
upon them. They encamped a regiment of Texas
cavalry at a beautiful spot near Iberville, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
"Camp Pratt." Franklin organized an attack upon
them. One night he sent our cavalry to make a
wide détour upon the prairie and get into their rear.
Then he attacked them in front with infantry. They
mounted and fled in disorder, and fell, nearly to a
man, into the hands of our cavalry. It was a well-organized
and well-conducted expedition, and reflected
credit upon Lee, who commanded the cavalry, and
upon Cameron, who commanded the infantry. Tradition
says that Dick Taylor, who commanded in
that part of Louisiana, swore "like our army in Flanders"
when he heard of it.</p>

<p>There is a very curious salt island near Iberville,
well worth a visit, in a scientific point of view.
Franklin wanted very much to explore it, but he did
not wish to take an army as an escort, and he said it
would be too absurd if he were captured on such an
expedition. It would not have been quite so absurd
for me, however; so I went, accompanied by Colonel
Professor Owen, of the Indiana University, and volunteers,
and with our head-quarters cavalry company
as an escort. The island lies in the Gulf, and is perhaps
half a mile in diameter. In the centre is a hollow
about a hundred yards across, which has all the
appearance of an extinct crater. Here, a few inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
below the surface, lies the salt, in an almost perfect
state of purity. For years our Southern brethren,
who do not shine as inventors, sunk wells, pumped
up the water, evaporated it, and so made their salt.
At last it occurred to some one more clever than his
neighbors, "Why not blast out the salt itself?" And
so it was done. It seems scarcely possible, and yet
I was credibly assured that so scarce was salt in the
Confederacy, that wagons came all the way from
Charleston, were loaded with salt, and returned to
that city. It must have been a journey of months.</p>

<p>We wintered at Franklin, preparing for a spring
campaign to the Red River. The climate of Louisiana
is delicious in winter. I have tried both the
South of France and Italy, but know no climate
equal to that of Louisiana. The summer, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en revanche</i>,
is intensely hot, and lasts from May to October, the
thermometer ranging from 86° at night to 96° in the
day-time. Yet the heat is not stifling. You feel
no particular inconvenience from it at the time; but
two seasons affect the nervous system seriously, and
a white man must from time to time get the Northern
or the sea-air. Happily the sea-coast is of easy
access from New Orleans.</p>

<p>But while our command was under canvas, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
preparing for the approaching campaign, the cavalry
was being mounted and drilled amidst the allurements
of a large city. Why Banks did not send it to
Thibodeaux, or to some other post where the prairie
gave admirable opportunities for cavalry exercise, is
a question which was often asked, but to which no
satisfactory answer has ever been given. Farragut
said that he feared that New Orleans would prove
Banks's Capua. One of the consequences, as regards
the cavalry, was, that they started upon the campaign
with "impedimenta" enough for an army. Crossing
a ford one day, Franklin spied a country cart
drawn by a mule, containing bedding, trunks, and a
negro woman. He sent the corps inspector to see to
whom it belonged. It turned out to be the property
of a sergeant of a cavalry regiment. Needless to say
that the cart went no farther. After the rebels had
captured their Champagne, sardines, and potted anchovies,
at Sabine Cross Roads, they became excellent
cavalry.</p>

<p>And now, fortunately for the navy, Bailey joined
our staff. He had done such good work at Port
Hudson&mdash;built half our works, got out a steamboat
that lay high and dry in the mud, etc., etc.&mdash;that
Banks had promoted him to be colonel of the reg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>iment,
over the head of the lieutenant-colonel.
Banks had no right to do this. In so doing, he had
usurped the prerogative of the Governor of Wisconsin;
and the governor, as might be expected, resented
it. Of course the governor was sustained by the
War Department. Bailey was, naturally enough,
annoyed and mortified, and wrote to me that he
should leave the service; indeed, he supposed that
he was already out of it, for he had been mustered
out as major when he was mustered in as colonel;
and now he had been mustered out as colonel. I
wrote to him not to go off at half-cock, to write
to the governor and ask in what capacity he recognized
him, and then to the adjutant-general and
ask the same question. He was answered by the
governor that he recognized him as lieutenant-colonel,
and by the Government that they recognized
him still as major. He then wrote me that he
would gladly remain in the service if I could get
him on Franklin's staff, but that, under the circumstances,
he could not return to his regiment. I
spoke to the general upon the subject, and mentioned
all that he had done under Sherman at Port
Hudson and elsewhere. The general applied for
him; he was ordered to report to us, and was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>nounced
as "Military Engineer of the Nineteenth
Army Corps." Thus it happened that Bailey was
with us when his regiment was not, and the fleet
on the Red River consequently saved from destruction
or capture.</p>

<p>I think it was on the 20th of March that we left
for the Red River. We marched the whole distance,
arriving at Natchitoches about the 3d of April.
From Alexandria to Natchitoches we followed the
Red River. Here began our mistakes. Banks arrived
from New Orleans, and ordered us to take the
inland road to Shreveport. Franklin suggested the
river road, where the army and the fleet could render
mutual support. Banks said no; that the other
was the shorter route. It was the shorter in distance,
but for the greater part of the way it was a
narrow wood road, unfitted for the march of troops
and the movement of artillery and wagons. We
marched two or three days without interruption.
Lee, who commanded the cavalry in advance, had
often applied for a brigade of infantry to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
him. Franklin had always declined to separate his
infantry, answering that if Lee found the enemy too
strong for him, to fall back, and we would come
up with the whole infantry force and disperse them.
On the evening of the 6th of April, I think it was,
Banks came up at Pleasant Hill, and assumed command.
The next day we were beaten; for that
evening Lee again applied for his infantry, and got
them. Franklin sent in a written remonstrance
against the danger of separating the infantry, and
having it beaten in detail. He was disregarded;
and we marched to certain defeat.</p>

<p>The battle of Sabine Forks&mdash;Mansfield, the rebels
call it; and as they won it, they have a right to
name it&mdash;scarcely rises to the dignity of a battle.
We had our cavalry and one brigade of infantry
only engaged. We lost heavily, however, in guns
and wagons, for the wagon-train of the cavalry followed
close upon its heels, and blocked up the narrow
road, so that the guns could not be got off.
When Franklin heard from Banks that the cavalry
and infantry brigade were seriously engaged, and
that he must send re-enforcements, he at once ordered
Emory up with the First Division of the Nineteenth
Corps, and then rode forward himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
scene of action. Here he lost his horse and was
wounded in the leg, while one of our staff officers
was killed. When our cavalry and brigade were
finally defeated, the rebels advanced upon us. It
was a striking and beautiful sight to see a column
of their best infantry&mdash;the "Crescent City Regiment,"
I think it was&mdash;marching steadily down
the road upon us, while their skirmishers swarmed
through the woods and cotton fields. The column
offered so beautiful a mark for a shell or two, that
the general rode up to a retreating gun, and tried
hard to get it into position, but the stampede was
too general, and we had to look to our own safety.
When he found how things were likely to turn out,
Franklin had sent an aid-de-camp to Emory with orders
to select a good position, come into line, and
check the advancing enemy. Meantime, we retreated,
abandoning the road&mdash;it was too blocked up&mdash;and
taking to the woods and across the cotton
fields, not knowing our whereabouts, or whether we
should land in the rebel lines or in our own. At
length we caught sight of Emory's red division flag,
and a joyful sight it was. We soon reached it, and
found that "Bold Emory" had chosen an excellent
position on the summit of a gentle eminence, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Peach Hill, and had already got his men into line.
His division had behaved admirably. In face of
cavalry and infantry retreating in disorder&mdash;and
every officer knows how contagious is a panic&mdash;the
First Division of the Nineteenth Army Corps steadily
advanced, not a man falling out, fell into line,
and quietly awaited the enemy. They did not keep
us waiting long. In less than half an hour after
we had joined the division, they appeared, marching
steadily to the attack. But they were received
with a fusillade they had not counted upon, and retreated
in confusion. Again they attempted an attack
on our right, but with no better success. They
were definitively repulsed.</p>

<p>In this skirmish Franklin had another horse killed
under him, shot in the shoulder, for the enemy's fire
was very sharp for a few minutes. I offered him
my horse, but he refused it. The captain of our
head-quarters cavalry company offered him his, and
he accepted it. The captain dismounted a private.</p>

<p>I saw here a striking instance of the effect produced
by the imagination when exalted by the excitement
of battle. A staff officer by my side dropped
his bridle, threw up his arms, and said, "I am
hit." I helped him from his horse. He said, "My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
boot is full of blood." We sent him to the ambulance.
I said to myself, "Good-bye to &mdash;&mdash; I shall
go to his funeral to-morrow." Next day he appeared
at head-quarters as well as ever. He had been
struck by a spent ball. It had broken the skin and
drawn a few drops of blood, but inflicted no serious
injury. At Port Hudson I saw the same effect produced
by a spent ball. A man came limping off the
field supported by two others. He said his leg was
broken. The surgeon was rather surprised to find
no hole in his stocking. Cutting it off, however, he
found a black-and-blue mark on the leg&mdash;nothing
more. The chaplain was reading to him, and the
man was pale as death. I comforted him by telling
him to send the stocking to his sweetheart as a trophy.</p>

<p>As we lay on our arms that night at Peach Hill
without fire, for we were permitted to light none,
lest we should reveal our small numbers to the enemy,
we could hear distinctly the yells of the rebels
as they found a fresh "cache" of the good things
of the cavalry. It was very aggravating. They got
our head-quarters ambulance too, but there was precious
little in it. Expecting to bivouac, we had
thrown a few things hastily into it. All they got
of mine was a tooth-brush. I comforted myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with the reflection that they would not know what
use to put it to.</p>

<p>Banks now sent for Franklin, and communicated
to him his intention to remain on the battle-field all
night, and renew the fight in the morning. Franklin
represented that we had six thousand men at
most, and the rebels thirteen thousand. Banks replied
that A. J. Smith would be up. (Smith was
thirteen miles in the rear, with eight thousand men.)
"But how is he to get up, sir? The road is blocked
up with the retreating troops and wagons, and
is but a path, after all. He can't get up." "Oh!
he'll be up&mdash;he'll be up;" and the interview ended.
On his return to head-quarters, partly under a tree
and partly on a rail fence, Franklin told me what
had happened.</p>

<p>General William Dwight, of Boston, commanded
the First Brigade of Emory's division. I knew
Dwight well, for he had succeeded Sherman in command
of our division at Port Hudson. I had recommended
him highly to Franklin, when he was offered
his choice of two or three generals for commands
in the Nineteenth Corps, as an officer who could be
thoroughly relied upon in an emergency. Dwight
had said to me, "Major, if Franklin ever wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Banks to do any thing, and he won't do it, do you
come to me." I thought that the time had arrived
to go to him; so I found my way through the darkness.
"Well, general, we've got to stay here all
night, and fight it out to-morrow." Dwight, who is
quick as a flash, and whose own soldierly instinct
told him what ought to be done, said at once, "Does
Franklin think Banks ought to fall back upon A. J.
Smith?" "Yes, he does." "Then I'll be d&mdash;d if
he sha'n't do it. Wait here a minute." Dwight
disappeared in the darkness. In ten minutes he returned
and said, "It's all right; the order is given."</p>

<p>That night we fell back upon Pleasant Hill,
Dwight bringing up the rear with his brigade.
Franklin asked him if he could hold his position till
half-past ten. "Till morning," he replied, "if you
say so."</p>

<p>At Pleasant Hill we found General Smith with
his "gorillas," as they were profanely called.
Smith's command boasted that they had been in
many a fight, and had never been defeated. I believe
it was a true boast. It was partly luck, partly
their own courage, and partly the skill with which
they were handled. They were a rough lot, but
good soldiers. I have seen them straggling along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
one with a chicken hung to his bayonet, another
with a pig on his back: turkeys, ducks, any thing of
the kind came handy to them. The alarm sounded,
and in an instant every man was in the ranks, silent,
watchful, orderly, the very models of good soldiers.</p>

<p>The battle which now ensued at Pleasant Hill
formed no exception to the rule which Smith's corps
had established. The rebels, too, had been re-enforced,
and attacked us in the afternoon with great
spirit. But they soon found the difference between
an affair with a single brigade of infantry, and one
with three divisions fully prepared and admirably
handled; for Franklin and Smith had made all the
dispositions. They drove in the left of our first line,
where we had a Five Points New York regiment
(rowdies, by-the-way, always make the poorest
troops); but they could make no impression on the
second line, composed of Smith's "gorillas," and
were beaten off with considerable loss.</p>

<p>General Dick Taylor, son of the President, commanded
the rebel army in these engagements, and
received much credit, and deservedly, for the manner
in which he had defeated us at Mansfield. It
was reported that General Smith, who commanded
the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>eracy,
found fault with Taylor for attacking us, as
he had intended to draw us on to Shreveport, and
there, with the help of Magruder from Texas, and
Price from Arkansas, overwhelm us disastrously.
Perhaps it was as well that we had it out at Mansfield.
As regards the affair at Pleasant Hill, it was
a mistake of the rebels. They were not strong
enough to attack us in position. Taylor has since
said that the attack was against his better judgment,
but that the officers who had come up the night before
wanted their share of glory. Perhaps, too, they
had tasted the cavalry Champagne, and liked the
brand. They might not have been quite so eager
for the fray had they known what force they had
to deal with at Mansfield, and what lay before them
at Pleasant Hill.</p>

<p>The writer has since met General Taylor in London,
and a most agreeable companion he is. He is
a great favorite in court circles, largely for his own
merits, but partly as "Prince Dick." In monarchical
countries they can not divest themselves of the
idea that our presidents are monarchs, and their
children princes. "Prince John," "Prince Dick,"
"Prince Fred," all received quasi-royal honors. At
Constantinople, when Fred Grant was with Sherman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a lieutenant on his staff, it was to Grant that the
Sultan addressed his remarks. Grant tried to stop
it, but could not.</p>

<p>They tell an amusing story of Dick Taylor in
London. Taylor plays a good game of whist. The
King of Denmark was on a visit to his daughter,
and she sent for Taylor to make up a game with
her father. Taylor won largely, and laughingly
said to the king, "Your majesty can not find fault;
I am only getting back those 'Sound Dues' my
country paid Denmark for so many years."</p>

<p>Banks now wanted to continue his onward march
to Shreveport, but A. J. Smith opposed it. He said
that he belonged to Sherman's command, and had
been lent to Banks for a season only; that he was
under orders to return to Sherman by a certain day;
that much time had been lost; and that if he undertook
the march to Shreveport, he could not return
by the date appointed. Our supplies, too, were
rather short, the cavalry having lost their wagon-train.
We fell back, therefore, upon Grand Ecore,
where we rejoined the fleet. And here a curious
incident occurred. An officer in high position came
to Franklin and said that the army was in a very
critical situation; that it required generalship to ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>tricate
it; that under Banks it would probably be
captured or destroyed; and proposed to put Banks on
board of a steamer, and send him to New Orleans,
and that Franklin should take command. "And
my men, general," he said, "will stand by you to
the last man." Of course Franklin treated it as a
joke, and laughed it off. But there can be no doubt
that the officer was in earnest.</p>

<p>General Banks did not command the confidence
of his troops, especially of the Western men. They
generally spoke of him as "<em>Mr.</em> Banks." It was a
great pity that his undoubted talent could not have
been utilized in the civil service. As it turned out,
he was perhaps the most striking instance in our
service of the grave, almost fatal, mistake we made
at the beginning of the war. He had been a good
Speaker, so we made him a major-general; he had
roused a certain interest in Massachusetts in her
militia, so we gave him command of armies, and
sent him out to meet trained soldiers like Stonewall
Jackson and Dick Taylor. The result was a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>The Red River had now fallen very low. The
gun-boats had great difficulty in descending the
stream. One chilly evening, as we stood round the
head-quarters camp-fire, word was brought us that
one of Porter's best iron-clads was fast aground in
the stream, and that they had tried in vain to get
her off. I turned laughingly to Bailey, and said,
"Bailey, can't you build a dam and get her off?"
alluding to what he had done at Port Hudson.
Bailey followed me to my tent and said, "Seriously,
major, I think I <em>could</em> get that ship off, and I should
like to try." I went immediately to the general,
and got a letter from him to Porter, and sent Bailey
to the grounded ship. She was built in compartments.
He found them breaking in the partitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
He remonstrated, and said, "Pump out one compartment,
then shut it hermetically, and the confined air
will help to buoy up the ship." The navy men, naturally
enough, resented the interference of an outsider.
Bailey gave Porter Franklin's letter. Porter
said, "Well, major, if you can dam better than I
can, you must be a good hand at it, for I have been
d&mdash;g all night." Bailey had not met with a very
encouraging reception. He was one of those serious
men, who, as Sydney Smith said, require a surgical
operation to get a joke into their heads. He
returned to camp, and reported to me that Porter
had insulted him. "What did he say, Bailey?" He
told me; whereupon I explained to him the joke,
and he was perfectly satisfied. "Oh, if that's what
he meant, it's all right!" The ship was not got off.
She was blown up and abandoned.</p>

<p>From Grand Ecore we fell back upon Alexandria.
Franklin was put in command of the movement, and
Bailey selected our line of march. We started at
dark, and marched all night. But the Confederates
were on the watch. They threatened our rear, and
compelled us to halt, and deploy, while they hurried
a strong force to take position at Kane's Ferry.
Here we had a sharp skirmish. The position is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
very strong one, the stream not being fordable at
the Ferry. We crossed two brigades higher up.
Moving slowly through the woods, for there were
no roads, they struck the rebels on the left flank,
and dislodged them. The fight was very sharp for a
time. Colonel Fessenden, afterward brigadier-general,
commanding a Maine regiment, and gallantly
leading it, lost a leg in this affair.</p>

<p>But a severer trial awaited the fleet. About a
mile above Alexandria the river shoots over a rapid,
the Falls of Alexandria. On this shoal there
was about five feet of water, and the river was falling.
The boats drew from seven to nine feet. The
floods come down with great rapidity in the Red
River. One night's rain would have given the ships
plenty of water. Twenty-four hours' hard rain raises
it twenty feet. But the rain would not come.
Things looked gloomy enough for the fleet. Bailey
came to me and said that he could build a dam in
ten days, and get those ships out. The river was
six hundred and sixty-six feet wide at the Falls.
Franklin sent me to Porter with the proposition.
Porter said that it was not worth while&mdash;"It will
rain to-night or to-morrow." To-night and to-morrow
came, and it did not rain, and still the river fell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Again Franklin sent me to Porter. I found him
unwell and despondent. "Tell General Franklin,"
he said, "that if he will build a dam or any thing
else, and get me out of this scrape, I'll be eternally
grateful to him." I returned to Franklin. "Now
go to Banks, and get his permission." I found
Banks closeted with General Hunter. It was reported
that the Government had become anxious
about our command, and had sent Hunter down to
examine and report upon our condition. I stated
what was proposed. Banks turned to Hunter and
said, "What do you think of it, general?" Hunter
replied that he thought it impracticable, "But if
Franklin recommends it, try it; for he is one of the
best engineers in the army." Banks said, "Tell the
general to give the necessary orders." The orders
were given. Maine and Wisconsin regiments, principally
lumbermen, were detailed for the work. In
ten days the dam was built, the water rose, and the
fleet came over in safety.</p>

<p>The rebels made a great mistake in not interfering
with our work. Had they done so, they might
have embarrassed us seriously on the left bank of
the river, opposite Alexandria. But they never
fired a shot. We were told that they laughed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
idea of damming the Red River, and said that we
might as well try to dam the Mississippi. We would
have done this, had it been necessary.</p>

<p>Bailey handled water as a lumberman handles his
axe. One of the gun-boats was aground, hanging by
the stern some little way above the Falls. They
tugged at her with all sorts of mechanical contrivances,
but in vain. In two hours Bailey built a little
"wing-dam," he called it, turned the current under
the stern of the vessel where she hung, washed
out the sand, and the ship floated off.</p>

<p>Porter told me that if Bailey got his fleet out he
would never rest till he was made a brigadier-general.
He kept his word. The Government promoted
him. The naval officers subscribed, and gave
him a sword of honor and a service of plate. He
deserved it all.</p>

<p>The fleet saved, we renewed our march to the
Mississippi. It was made without incident, except
that Smith defeated the rebels in a skirmish on the
Atchafalaya. He practiced a ruse upon them: concealed
a brigade in the deep dry ditches that intersect
the sugar-fields there, then sent his skirmishers
out. The rebs drove them in and pursued them;
when up rose the men in the ditches, poured in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
deadly fire, and took two hundred prisoners. We
were not again troubled by the enemy.</p>

<p>Prince Polignac commanded the rebels upon this
occasion. It was reported that he had come to Louisiana
expecting that the Confederacy would become
a monarchy; and it probably would have done so,
had the Rebellion succeeded. I afterward heard that
his defeat was not very disagreeable to his brother
officers, for he was not popular with them. Indeed,
very few foreign officers were popular on either side.
Both Union and rebel officers were very much disposed
to look upon it as a family quarrel, and wanted
no interference from outsiders.</p>

<p>We crossed the Atchafalaya by a novel bridge
constructed of steamboats. This, too, was Bailey's
work. He anchored them side by side, the bows
level with each other, and placed planks across them.
The whole army, with its baggage-wagons and artillery,
crossed safely and rapidly. A steam-whistle
sounded, and in ten minutes the bridge had disappeared,
and every boat was under full headway to
its destination.</p>

<p>The writer's connection with the Department of
the Gulf now ceased for a year. He obtained leave
of absence, and went North. But he had scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
arrived there when Early made his daring march
upon Washington. My leave was revoked, and I
was ordered to report to Major-general Gillmore.
For a year I remained in Virginia, most of the time
in Norfolk, for Gillmore had been thrown from his
horse, and was unable to take the field in command
of the Nineteenth Army Corps, as had been intended,
and I had been assigned to a different duty.
Early in the spring of 1865, on application of Brigadier-general
T. W. Sherman, I was ordered again to
New Orleans.</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival at the North, I paid a
visit of a few days to Colonel Badeau at Grant's
head-quarters at City Point. Badeau had been with
me on Sherman's staff. I staid at head-quarters in a
tent reserved for guests, and messed with the general
and his staff. Grant has the reputation of being a
taciturn man, and he is generally so. But when
seated on a summer's evening under the awning in
front of his tent with his staff, and, perhaps, a few
friends about him, he took his share of the conversation.
He was full of anecdote, especially of army
life. He talked very freely, not hesitating to express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
his opinions of men and things. Grant contended
that no commanding officer could succeed in the long
run, if he were not an honest and an honorable man.
He did not care what were his talents, he was sure
to come to grief, and injure the cause sooner or later.
But Butler took different ground. He held that he
could appoint clever and energetic officers to command,
and benefit by their talents, while he could
prevent their dishonesty from injuring the cause.
Grant was undoubtedly right, and Butler wrong.</p>

<p>One evening, as we sat before his tent, Grant observed
that he had that day sent orders to remove a
certain general from high command in the West. I
expressed my surprise, and said that I had always
understood, and from army men too, that the officer
in question was one of the best of our volunteer generals.
Grant took his cigar from his mouth, and remarked,
in his quiet way, "He's too much mixed up
with cotton."</p>

<p>Politics makes strange bed-fellows. What a pity
that President Grant was unable to carry into his
civil appointments the same admirable principle
upon which General Grant acted so inflexibly and
so successfully in his military appointments! The
officer whom he removed from command as "too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
much mixed up with cotton" he soon after appointed,
under strong party pressure, to high civil office.</p>

<p>On my return to New Orleans, I found that Banks
had been relieved, and Canby now commanded the
Department of the Gulf. He was absent, engaged
in the campaign against Mobile, which resulted in
the capture of that city. Here Bailey again distinguished
himself. The bay was strewed with torpedoes.
Bailey had no fear of torpedoes. He told
me that he had often navigated the Upper Mississippi
when enormous cakes of ice, swept along by
the rapid current, threatened to destroy the boat, but
that it was easy enough by some mechanical contrivance
to avoid them. He thought that torpedoes
might be treated in the same way. He showed his
faith by his works. He took the quartermaster's
boats up without accident. The navy followed his
lead, and safely. But the Admiral, changing his
mind, ordered some of the boats back. In backing
down, two were blown up and sunk.</p>

<p>But the war was now near its close. Bailey was
shortly afterward mustered out of service, and returned
to civil life. He removed from Wisconsin to
Missouri, and settled in one of the border counties.
Here he was elected sheriff. His end was a sad one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
With his usual daring, he attempted to arrest two
noted desperadoes, horse-thieves, single-handed.
They murdered him. He had not lived in vain.
He had rendered good service to his country.</p>

<p>To return to Louisiana. The writer was now promoted
to General Canby's staff, and became adjutant-general
of the Department. Canby enjoyed the
full confidence of the Government, and most justly.
He had an exceedingly important command, extending
from St. Louis to the Gulf, and from Florida to
Texas. We had one hundred and eighty-seven thousand
men upon our rolls. Canby was an excellent
military commander, but his forte lay in civil government.
Never was a Department better governed
than was Louisiana in his day. A kind-hearted, benevolent
gentleman, he gave one half of his pay to
the rebel poor. Often have I seen his wife driving
about New Orleans, accompanied by a Sister of Charity,
dispensing his bounty. A clear-headed, just
man, he governed that turbulent city with wisdom
and justice, and with unflinching firmness. There
were no riots in his day. More than once we were
told that a riot was planned for the next day. Canby
sent for Sherman; that night a battery would be
quietly marched up from Jackson Barracks, and sta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>tioned
out of sight in a cotton-press. Very early in
the morning a company of cavalry picketed their
horses in Esplanade Street. The quiet citizens saw
nothing unusual, but the would-be rioters of course
knew what had been done, and there was no riot.
Canby was relieved; Sherman got leave of absence;
and within a month a riot took place.</p>

<p>General Canby has saved millions of money to
the United States. In these days of barefaced raids
upon the Treasury, under color of bogus Southern
claims, Canby's foresight and care are brought out
in strong relief. When the war was ended, he returned
all confiscated rebel property to its owners,
but he took from them a release to the United States
for all claim for rent or damage during our occupation.
These men's mouths are now closed. The
only exception he made was made most reluctantly
under the orders of Sheridan. That great soldier
does not shine in civil government as he does in the
field. When he arrived in New Orleans, he told
General Canby that he came there to take military
command; that as for civil matters he knew nothing
about them, and left them all to Canby. Before a
month had passed an order came that General Canby
would please report why he did not return the Me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>tairie
Ridge Race-course to its owners. This course
was owned by gamblers. The gamblers of New Orleans
are an institution and a power in that city.
Canby replied with the indorsement, "Respectfully
returned with a copy of the order bearing date (a
month back) returning the Metairie Ridge Racecourse
to its owners on the usual conditions." The
order came back, "General Canby will return the
Metairie Ridge Race-course without condition."
Canby felt deeply hurt. His carefully devised and
impartially executed plan to protect the Treasury
had been frustrated, and this in favor of a lot of
gamblers. I do not doubt that these men are now
before Congress as "loyal citizens," with their humble
petition for reimbursement for the occupation of
the race-course and the destruction of the fences.</p>

<p>Had Canby been permitted to have his own way,
the levees in Louisiana would have been rebuilt in
the fall of 1865, millions of money saved to the
United States, and much suffering and vagabondage
among the inhabitants avoided. In 1862 Butler had
confiscated the crops on many abandoned estates.
This property, when sold, realized a fund which was
turned over to the successive Department commanders,
to be used for various public purposes. Banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
gave a monster concert, with artillery accompaniments,
out of it, and balls, to dance the fair Creoles
into loyalty. Canby proposed to rebuild the levees.
In his day the fund amounted to about eight hundred
thousand dollars. He thought that this money,
raised in Louisiana, could with propriety be expended
in repairing the levees in Louisiana. He said expressly
that the rebels had no right to this expenditure&mdash;as
they had sown, so must they reap; but that
it was in the interest of the United States and of humanity
that he proposed to rebuild the levees. That
if this were done, the people would be occupied, contented,
and quiet, they would be no expense to the
Government, and their crops would add to the general
wealth of the country. That if it were not done,
the plantations would be overflowed, the crops ruined,
the inhabitants discontented, the value of the
crops lost to the country, and the United States compelled,
as a matter of humanity, to issue rations to
the starving people. In the month of October, 1865,
every thing was ready, the unemployed negroes enrolled,
our negro regiments detailed, and the work
about to commence, when it was stopped by an order
from General Sheridan. Of course Sheridan did not
do this from any mere caprice. He had his reasons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and to his mind they were conclusive. But they
were purely technical and narrow. He said that the
fund referred to did not belong to the Department;
that it belonged to the Treasury, or at least to the
Quartermaster-general, and could not be used without
his assent. Canby was always most reluctant to
appeal from his superior officer to higher authority,
but he thought that in this instance the interests of
his Department, and those of the United States itself,
were too deeply involved for him to accept Sheridan's
decision. He appealed to Washington, and
was sustained. But the Government, instead of ordering
him to commence the work at once, sent out a
board of engineers&mdash;Barnard at the head&mdash;to survey
the levees, and agree upon plans for repairing them.
At length all these most unnecessary formalities were
got through with, and Canby was ordered to proceed
with the work. This was promptly done. But it
was now January, instead of October. In February
the water rose, and swept away all that had been
done. All the evils predicted by Canby now came
upon the country. And not for that year only, but
for several succeeding years, the Government was
compelled to feed a suffering, discontented, and turbulent
population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Several nice and novel legal questions arose on the
termination of the war in reference to confiscated
property. These were determined by General Canby
so wisely and so justly that the Quartermaster-general
not unfrequently sent to him for copies of his
orders as guides for the Department at Washington
in its own decisions. I recollect one question particularly,
which brought him into conflict with the
United States District Judge. It will be remembered
that at the close of the war an immense quantity
of cotton was found stored in the by-ways of the Confederacy,
especially far up the Red River. Part of
this cotton was undoubtedly liable to confiscation,
but the greater part was not. Treasury agents
thronged all over the South. The character of these
men "left much to be desired," as the Frenchman
politely puts it. They were "on the make." Their
object was to prove all cotton liable to confiscation,
for the law gave them a large percentage of the proceeds.
The amount of perjury committed by these
men, and by the professional perjurers whom they
employed, was fearful. The effect was demoralizing
to the last degree, and exasperated the inhabitants;
while it was the object of the Government, and the
earnest desire of the victorious North, to pacify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
South by dealing not only justly, but generously, by
it. Canby felt this, and with his usual sagacity and
foresight made a proposition to the Secretary of the
Treasury, which, if adopted, would have saved the
Government millions in money, and more than millions
in peace and good-will. He proposed that ports
should be designated on the Mississippi for the receipt
of cotton; that every pound arriving there
should pay the Government twenty-five cents, or
fifty cents (any thing that the Government might
designate), and that no questions should be asked as
to its origin. Mr. M'Culloch replied that it was an
admirable plan, but that there were reasons why it
could not be adopted. The reason, I fear, was the
influence brought to bear at Washington by the nascent
race of carpet-baggers. There was money in
the Treasury-agent system.</p>

<p>This system led, as I have said, to a collision between
the military and the judicial authorities in
New Orleans, which in any other hands than Canby's
might have been serious. M'Culloch wrote to
the general asking him to sustain his agents with the
military power in their seizure of cotton. Canby
of course replied that he would do so. Shortly afterward
an agent applied to us for a military force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
He had seized a lot of cotton, and brought it to New
Orleans. The owner, an alleged Union man, had
applied to the United States District Court, and the
United States Marshal had been ordered to take possession
of it. He attempted to do so, but was, of
course, repulsed by the military, the city being still
under martial law. The judge thereupon issued an
order for Canby to appear before him, and show
cause why he held the cotton against the process of
the court. The order was an impertinent one; for
the judge knew well enough that the city was still
under martial law. The judge was that Durell who
afterward came to grief. But Canby always showed
the greatest respect to the judiciary. I remember,
as if it were yesterday, seeing him start for the
court-room at the appointed time, in full uniform,
accompanied by Major De Witt Clinton, his judge-advocate.
His return to the order of the court was
to my mind conclusive. He said, substantially, that
the United States District Court was a creation of
the law; that it possessed precisely those powers
which had been conferred upon it by Congress, and
no others; that if this cotton had been captured by
the navy on the high seas, he should have surrendered
it at once on the order of the judge, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
court was clothed with admiralty jurisdiction, but
that it had no military jurisdiction, and that he had
no right to surrender, and might be held responsible
for surrendering, powers which, under martial
law, were vested in him alone. The judge reserved
his decision. The claimant's lawyers telegraphed to
the President; and Johnson, who was then beginning
to coquet with the Democrats, contrary to Stanton's
advice, and without waiting for Canby's report,
ordered the cotton to be given up, to the general's
great satisfaction; for it soiled the fingers of every
one who touched it.</p>

<p>General Canby had now been thwarted twice by
General Sheridan in purely civil matters&mdash;matters
belonging properly to the commander of the Department.
He felt as if his usefulness were gone,
and prepared a letter to the Adjutant-general asking
to be relieved from his command, and ordered elsewhere.
He showed me this letter. I felt that his
loss to the Department would be irreparable, and I
persuaded him to withhold it. But shortly afterward
Sheridan again interfered with the civil government
of the city, and this time by breaking up
the provost-marshal's department of General Canby's
own staff. It is a matter of great delicacy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
one general to interfere with the staff of another.
Canby felt deeply hurt, and told me that he should
forward his letter to Washington. Of course I
could no longer object; for it seemed to me that
self-respect left him no choice. He was relieved
at once, for he was all-powerful with Stanton, who
had the highest esteem and regard for him, and
unbounded confidence in his integrity and wisdom.
He was made president of a most important board
on war claims, sitting at Washington. But shortly
afterward there was disturbance in Texas, and Canby
was immediately sent there. Again, there was
disturbance in Virginia, and Canby was transferred
to Richmond. Then came difficulty in South Carolina,
and at once Canby was ordered to Charleston.
Wherever he went, order and tranquillity followed
his footsteps.</p>

<p>This wise, great, and good man lost his life miserably.
He fell a victim to the Peace Commission.
He commanded the Department in which Captain
Jack and those wretched Modocs gave us so much
trouble. Although the force operating against the
Indians numbered but five hundred men, and the
weather was so severe that the ink froze in his tent,
Canby thought it his duty to go in person to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"Lava Beds." Here he was rapidly unearthing the
savages from "their caves and dens in the rocks,"
when the Peace Commission begged him to send
the Indians a flag of truce and invite them to a
"talk." He replied that it was useless; that he
knew the Indians far better than those gentlemen
could; and that the best and most humane method
was to follow up his military advantages. They entreated,
and appealed to his love of peace. He yielded,
went unarmed and without escort to the conference,
and was murdered by the savages. Thus died
one of the best, ablest, and purest men the war had
brought to the front.</p>

<p>The writer left Louisiana in June, 1866, and shortly
afterward, on his own request, was mustered out
of the service. He looks back with pleasure to
the years passed in that lovely and fruitful land.
He regrets the evil days which have fallen upon it,
and can not but think that the upright and honorable
men whom he knew there&mdash;and there are plenty
of them among its inhabitants&mdash;must regret the loss
of the rule of justice, law, order, and economy under

<p>In October, 1866, at the request of General Canby,
Mr. Seward appointed the writer to be Assistant
Secretary of Legation at Paris. Johnson was then
President, but he very properly left all these minor
appointments in the State Department to its chief.
Frederic Seward told me that it was impossible to
have a better friend at their court than General Canby&mdash;"they
always accepted his bills at sight."</p>

<p>General Dix had then been named Minister to
France, but had not sailed. Mr. Bigelow still filled
the office. On presenting my credentials, he requested
me to await the arrival of the General before
entering upon my duties, that the proposed changes
might all be made at the same time.</p>

<p>Late in December General Dix arrived, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
presented. Court carriages were sent for the minister,
and he was accompanied by the secretaries of
legation, and by the "Introducteur des Ambassadeurs"
in gorgeous uniform. Those were the halcyon
days of the diplomatic service, before Congress
had come to the conclusion that the safety of the
republic depended upon its foreign representatives
being dressed in swallow-tail coats. We were then
permitted to dress like other gentlemen of the diplomatic
corps in the same grade.</p>

<p>The Emperor was always happy in his reception of
the diplomates accredited to him. The custom was
to send in advance to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
a copy of the address to be delivered, that the Emperor's
reply might be prepared. These speeches,
under ordinary circumstances, might be stereotyped:
change the names, and one will answer for another.
After the formal addresses, an informal conversation
followed. General Dix then presented the secretaries.
The Emperor spoke English very well, and
liked to ventilate it. He did not speak it perfectly,
however, as was claimed by his enthusiastic admirers.
He translated French into English, as we so often
translate English into French. He said, for instance,
to Colonel Hay, "You have made <em>ze</em> war in <em>ze</em> Uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>ted
States?" ("<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous avez fait la guerre?</i>") meaning,
"Did you serve?" Hay was strongly tempted
to tell him that it was not he; it was Jeff Davis.</p>

<p>After the presentation to the Emperor, we paid our
respects to the Empress. That charming and beautiful
woman was then in the zenith of her beauty
and grace. She received us in her bonnet and walking-dress,
as she had come from mass; for in Catholic
countries diplomatic presentations generally take
place on Sunday. Nor in Catholic countries only,
for in England the Prince of Wales sometimes receives
on that day. The Empress too speaks English,
and with less accent than the Emperor, though
not so fluently.</p>

<p>The imperial court in 1866-'67 was at the height
of its splendor. France was apparently prosperous
and powerful, and Paris reigned the queen-city of
the world. All nations paid her willing tribute.
She was preparing for the Exhibition of 1867, the
most successful ever held, except our own at Philadelphia.
The winter was unusually gay, the palace
setting the example. As a rule, the Emperor gave
four grand balls during the season. They were very
magnificent, and would have been very pleasant except
for the great crowd. But those balls were given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
principally to the military, and the garrison of Paris
thronged them to the number of two or three thousand.
Some of the subordinate officers were wholly
unused to any other society than that of the barracks,
and they brought their barrack manners with them,
crowding, pushing, treading upon the ladies' dresses,
scratching their shoulders with their epaulets.
When the supper-room was opened, the Centgarde
on duty at the door had great difficulty in keeping
back the hungry crowd. Once they actually broke
through and rushed in. The sentries were thereupon
doubled, but even then were compelled to
threaten to report the most prominent disturbers
to the Emperor. Every private in the Centgardes
ranked as an officer of the army.</p>

<p>It may interest some of my readers to know how
presentations were made at these balls. The United
States Minister was allowed to present twenty-six
persons in all. They were selected generally upon
the principle of first come, first served; but the matter
rested wholly in his discretion. No one had a
right to a presentation. Mr. Seward settled this in
a clear and positive dispatch to Mr. Dayton, and his
instructions now regulate the action of our ministers
in most of the courts of Europe. Occasionally we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
asked for one or two extra presentations. The inquiry
was then generally made, "Is it a young and
pretty woman?" If it were, there was no difficulty,
for the Empress, like other ladies, was pleased to
have her balls set off with beautiful and well-dressed
women. American ladies were always well received
by her for this reason. Her balls were sometimes
called by the envious "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bals américains</i>."</p>

<p>The persons to be presented were arranged round
one of the rooms at the Tuileries. The Emperor
entered and passed down the line, each person being
named to him. He sometimes stopped, though rarely,
and addressed a few words to one of the presentees.
The Empress followed in the same manner.
She exacted that every lady should be in full evening
dress, and if by chance one slipped in not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décolletée</i>,
the minister was pretty sure to hear of it. General
Dix was once asked to present a young lady
with her mother. He consented. She turned out
to be a child of fourteen. Before many days he
heard that the Empress had said that she did not
receive children.</p>

<p>But the Empress's Mondays, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits lundis</i>, were
charming. They were not unpleasantly crowded,
and they were composed exclusively of people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
knew how to behave themselves. Frequently they
were musical parties, and there one heard the best
musical talent of the world. No money was paid to
the leading artists; for the theory is that the honor
of singing before the sovereign is sufficient; but a
bracelet or other piece of jewelry was sent to the
singer, and always of value, for the Emperor was
very generous&mdash;too much so for his own interests
and those of his family, as events have shown.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits lundis</i> were a paradise for our American
diplomates. There we wore our swallow-tail
coats, with black tights and silk stockings. The
most rabid anti-uniformist could not object to that.
To wear swallow-tail at one of the balls, however,
was by no means a pleasant duty. After one or two
experiments our secretaries gave up going. The
French officers&mdash;not those of high rank, of course&mdash;would
stare with all the impertinence they could
muster, and take the opportunity to jostle them accidentally
in the crowd. It was very different in
London. If one of us went to a ball at Buckingham
Palace in mufti, the page at the door simply asked,
"United States, sir?" and he passed in without difficulty.
Of course every one present noticed the
dress, but no one appeared to do so. They evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>ly
felt sorry for the poor devil who found himself
in such an awkward fix, and wished to make it as
easy for him as possible. French politeness did not
shine by the contrast.</p>

<p>Early in the winter the Emperor opened the Corps
Législatif. In all constitutional monarchies this is
an occasion of great ceremony and splendor. A hall
in the Louvre was used for the purpose. All the
great bodies of state attended in their gorgeous uniforms.
Senators, deputies, judges, members of the
Academy and of the Institute, marshals, admirals&mdash;every
thing that France possessed of glorious in
arms, or eminent in literature, science, art, and statesmanship,
was congregated there. When all was
ready, the Empress, attended by the ladies of the imperial
family, and by her ladies in waiting, walked
up the whole length of the centre aisle to her seat
on the throne, amidst the indescribable enthusiasm
of the audience. Her beauty, her grace, and her
stately bearing carried the enthusiasm to its height.
You would have sworn that every man there was
ready to die for his sovereign. Within less than
four years she sought in vain for one of them to
stand by her in her hour of danger.</p>

<p>The opening of the Corps Législatif, splendid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
interesting as it was, did not compare in either respect&mdash;in
American eyes, at least&mdash;with the opening
of Parliament by the Queen in person. She has
done this so rarely of late that, when she does appear,
the interest and excitement in London are very
great. The ceremony takes place in the House of
Lords. The peers are in their robes of office, scarlet
and ermine. Each particular robe is ugly enough,
very much like red flannel and cat-skin; but the effect
of all together is very fine. The peeresses are
in full dress. The diplomatic corps are present in
their rich uniforms. The princes enter and take
their seats as lords. That graceful and beautiful
woman, the Princess of Wales&mdash;perhaps the most
beautiful woman in England&mdash;and the Princess
Mary and the Duchess of Edinburgh, follow and
take their seats upon the wool-sack facing the
throne. When all is ready, the Queen, preceded by
the white rod and the black rod (they call them the
"sticks" in England), the lord chancellor and the
lord chamberlain, and all her high officers of state,
appears and seats herself upon the throne, the Princess
Louise and the Princess Beatrice supporting her
on either side. Short and stout as is the Queen,
she has the most graceful and stately walk perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in Europe. It is a treat to see her move. Then the
lower doors are opened; there is a rush and a scramble,
and loud voices are heard, and the Commons of
England, headed by their Speaker, the very body for
whom all this show and state and splendor are got
up, crowd into a narrow space behind a railing, and
there stand while the Queen reads her speech. It
seems strange, when one reflects that the Commons
really govern England, to see them shut out in the
cold as if they were not fit to associate with the distinguished
company present. When the speech is
finished, the Speaker bows, the Queen descends from
the throne, the Commons return to their House, and
the pageant is ended.</p>

<p>The Great Exhibition opened on the 1st of May,
1867. It was not nearly ready, but was opened
punctually to the day with all the well-arranged
ceremony for which the French are noted. The
sovereigns of Europe began to flock to Paris. "The
Grand Duchess of Gerolstein" was then in the full
tide of success at one of the theatres. It was odd
to note that among the first visits the great royalties
paid (the Emperor of Russia and the King
of Prussia) was one to "The Grand Duchess."
The minor sovereigns, the kinglings, rarely went;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and when they did, they saw nothing amusing
in it.</p>

<p>The diplomatic corps had admirable opportunities
to see the different sovereigns visiting Paris. It is
the custom for a monarch to receive the diplomatic
corps accredited to the capital at which he is a guest.
We stood in a circle, and, while the royal visitor
talked to our own minister and to those near him on
either side, we had excellent opportunities to study
his features, expression, and manners. The most
agreeable of them all, with an apt word for every
one, was the King of the Belgians. He had a great
deal to say to General Dix about Mr. Seward, whom
he had known, and the port of Antwerp as convenient
for American shipping. He spoke English
admirably. He was accompanied by the Queen, a
young and pretty woman, who, by-the-way, was the
only sovereign lady who came to the Exposition,
much to the Empress's disappointment, and somewhat,
it was said, to her mortification. Next in tact
to the King of the Belgians came the Emperor of
Austria, a small, well-made, military-looking man,
with most polished manners. He spoke to me&mdash;for
General Dix was then temporarily absent&mdash;of his
brother, the Emperor Maximilian, and expressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
gratitude to our Government for its efforts to save
his life. Later, while <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé</i> at London, I met the
Empress of Germany. She, too, has the gift of saying
the right thing in the right place. I heard her
conversation with two or three of my colleagues who
stood near me. It was always happy. To me she
spoke of all that the Legation at Paris had done to
protect "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mes pauvres Allemands dans ces tristes, ces
pénibles circonstances</i>." She was glad to have the
opportunity to thank me in person, and wished me
to convey her thanks to Mr. Washburne.</p>

<p>But the chief guest, the man to whom all eyes
were turned, was the Emperor of Russia, a pale,
handsome, silent, gentlemanly-looking man. For
him reviews were held, gala operas given, and magnificent
fêtes at the Tuileries and at the Hôtel de
Ville. I doubt if the world ever saw a more beautiful
fête than that given to him by the Empress at
the Tuileries. It was summer, the month of June.
The gardens of the palace were closed to the public.
The flower-beds (the flowers were then in full bloom)
were bordered with gas-jets, the trees were festooned
with variegated lamps, the fountains played, and
electric lights&mdash;blue, pink, and yellow&mdash;were thrown
alternately upon the sparkling waters. It was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
beautiful. And when, at midnight, the Empress, accompanied
by a number of ladies, and by the Emperors
and their suites, descended into the gardens, and
the electric light flashed on their bright dresses and
jewels, and brilliant uniforms, the effect was fairy-like.</p>

<p>The review was next in order. Sixty thousand
men passed before the Emperors without check or
delay. The King of Prussia was present, accompanied
by Bismarck and Moltke. Bismarck even then
attracted much attention. I have rarely seen a finer-looking
man. More than six feet high, large and
powerful in proportion, with a grand head well set
upon the shoulders, he looks like Agamemnon&mdash;"king
of men."</p>

<p>It was on the return from this review that the
Emperor of Russia was shot at by a Pole. Fortunately,
he was not hit. The only creature hurt was
the horse of one of the equerries. The blood spurted
from a wound in the animal's neck upon the Emperor's
second son, who was in the carriage with
him. The father's only thought was for his son;
and, leaning forward, he laid his hand tenderly upon
him while he anxiously inquired if he was wounded.
It was reported that the Emperor of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
turned to his imperial guest, and said, "Sire, we have
been under fire together for the first time to-day;"
to which the Emperor replied, with much solemnity
of manner, "Sire, we are in the hands of Providence."</p>

<p>That evening I saw him at a ball at the Russian
embassy. It was very small, not more than two hundred
persons present. He looked pale and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i>,
evidently anticipating, with some apprehension, the
effect to be produced in Russia, and upon her relations
with France, when the news should reach St.
Petersburg. Madame Haussmann, the wife of the
Prefect of the Seine, a well-meaning woman, but
who did not shine precisely by her tact, was trying
to make conversation with him. He looked over
her head, as if he did not see her, and finally turned
upon his heel and left her. It was not perhaps polite,
but it was very natural. The Emperor and Empress
of the French made extraordinary exertions to
enliven the ball, but there was a perceptible oppression
in the air. The would-be assassin was not condemned
to death. Strange to say, a French jury
found "extenuating circumstances." But the French
sympathize strongly with the Poles; and I doubt if,
under any circumstances, a French jury would con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>demn
to death a Pole who had attempted to murder
a Russian.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Russia is a man of the highest
sense of personal honor. When lately he sought an
interview with the English embassador, and assured
him on his honor that he had no thought of conquest,
or any desire to occupy Constantinople, those
who know his character believed him implicitly. It
was reserved for certain ultra Tory journals in London
to doubt his word. No language would be
strong enough for these journals to employ if a
Russian newspaper were to doubt the word of honor
of Lord Derby or any other prominent English gentleman.
Happily, the <cite>Standard</cite> and its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</i>
do not yet direct public opinion in England.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1867, the Exhibition closed with
great ceremony, and Paris settled down for a time
to the even tenor of its way. In 1868, General
Grant was elected President, and was inaugurated
in 1869. In the spring of this year General Dix
resigned. He preferred the comforts of his home,
with the society of his children and grandchildren,
to the attractions of the imperial court. No minister
ever represented the United States with more
dignity than General Dix. A man of marked abil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ity,
an accomplished scholar and gentleman, he possessed
precisely those qualities which are the most
highly prized at a court like that of France. The
ladies, too, of his family shone in their sphere; a
matter of much greater importance than is generally
supposed in our country. The general has left a
very pleasant impression in France; and not unfrequently
since the fall of the empire I have been
stopped in the street by some sad looking ex-official
with inquiries after his health.</p>

<p>In the month of May, 1869, Mr. Washburne arrived
in France, and entered upon the duties of his
office. In the mean time I had been promoted, at the
request of General Dix, to be secretary of legation.
At Mr. Washburne's request, I was retained in that
position. Paris was uneasy and restless. Conspiracies
against the empire were rife. The Republicans,
as they called themselves&mdash;Radicals is a better name
for the majority of them&mdash;became bold and defiant.
France was jealous, too, of the renown acquired by
Prussia at Sadowa. She had been so accustomed to
consider herself, and to be considered, the first military
power in the world, that she could not bear the
semblance of a rival near the throne. The Emperor
was suffering from the disease of which he afterward
died, and no longer governed with "the hand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
steel in the glove of silk" always needed in France.
The Church was alarmed at the rise of a great Protestant
power, and the Empress sympathized with her
Church. In short, public sentiment had reached
such a pass in France, or rather in Paris, which is
France, that the Emperor was compelled to choose
between war and revolution. He naturally chose
war. It was definitely resolved upon on the 15th
July, 1870, but not officially declared until the 19th.
I was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i>, Mr. Washburne being absent
at Carlsbad.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July I went to the sitting of the
Corps Législatif to learn what were the prospects of
war. In the tribune of the diplomatic corps I met
the Spanish Embassador. He told me that peace
was assured, as he had persuaded Prince Hohenzollern
to decline the proffered crown of Spain, and that
now nothing remained to fight about. On the 14th,
I went again. I found Lord Lyons there, and, falling
into conversation with him, he left the impression
upon my mind that there would be war, for the
proffered mediation of England had failed. Lord
Lyons had come to the sitting expecting to hear an
authoritative declaration by the Government, and
this declaration he thought would be warlike. I at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
once telegraphed to Mr. Fish that the chances were
strongly in favor of war. This, and all our subsequent
telegrams in cipher, were delayed by the
French Government for twenty-four hours, probably
with a view to decipher them. On the 15th I was
again at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i>, and heard the warlike declaration
made by the Government. It was not the
formal declaration of war, but was equivalent to it.
Thereupon Mr. Thiers rose, and attempted to address
the House in a speech deprecating hostilities. The
scene that followed was indescribable and most disgraceful
to any legislative body. The great mass of
the members sprung to their feet, pointed their fingers
at the orator, yelled, and shouted "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traître, traître!
Allez à Berlin!</i>" The little man stood like a
rock, and when the tumult had somewhat subsided,
I could hear his shrill, piping voice raised in solemn
warning against the step they were about to take.
The Government had stated that their embassador
had been insulted by the King of Prussia. Mr.
Thiers asked that the dispatches might be produced,
that the Assembly might judge for itself. This the
Government refused; and, on a show of hands, but
twenty members&mdash;among whom were Favre, Arago,
Simon, Pelletan, and others, most of them afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
prominent in the Government of the National Defense&mdash;voted
with Thiers.</p>

<p>While the debate was proceeding I was called out
by the messenger of the Legation, with word that
the German Embassador was very anxious to see me.
As soon as the proceedings in the Corps Législatif
were ended, I went to the German embassy. The
embassador told me that he had been instructed by
his Government to ask the United States Legation
at Paris to assume the protection of the North Germans
in France during the coming war. I saw at
once the importance of this step, the compliment
paid us by a great power like Germany, and the advantages
to the country. I replied that I felt confident
that my Government would gladly assume the
charge; that if there were no cable across the Atlantic,
and it were necessary to say "Yes" or "No" at
once, I should say "Yes;" but as there was telegraphic
communication, and I could receive an answer in
forty-eight hours, I must ask instructions from Mr.
Fish. He appeared to be disappointed, and inquired
when I could give him an answer, as he must leave
Paris in two days. He evidently desired the matter
to be settled before he left. I told him that I
thought I should receive a reply within that time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
I went at once to the office, and telegraphed Mr.
Fish as follows. This telegram, like the other, was
detained for twenty-four hours by the French Government.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="smcap rt">"Hoffman."</p>
</div>

<p>On the 17th I received Mr. Fish's answer, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">
<p class="p1 fs80 right">"Washington, July 16th, 1870.</p>

<p class="smcap rt">"Fish."</p>
</div>

<p>On receipt of this instruction, I wrote at once to
the Duke de Gramont, to ask for the assent of the
French Government. My note was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

</div>

<p class="p1">The Duke de Gramont replied, on the 18th, that
the French Government gave its "entire assent,"
whereupon I telegraphed to Mr. Fish as follows:</p>

<p>I learned afterward that my note to the Duke de

cabinet. The French Government had already
requested the good offices of Great Britain to protect
French subjects in North Germany, and it had fully
expected that North Germany would make a similar
request. Speculation was therefore rife in official
circles as to what the action of Count Bismarck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
meant. It was supposed that he anticipated a general
European war, into which Great Britain would
necessarily be drawn; and preferred, therefore, to
ask the good offices of a power which under all circumstances
was likely to remain neutral.</p>

<p>The Duke de Gramont was then Minister of Foreign
Affairs, and was supposed to have had much to
do with bringing on the war. The story was current
in Paris that, when he was embassador at Vienna,
Bismarck represented Prussia. They quarreled,
and Bismarck remarked of him, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est l'homme
le plus bête d'Europe.</i>" He never forgave it. At
Vienna he naturally associated with the Viennese
aristocracy, who disliked the Prussians. From them
he got the idea that Austria would readily join
France in a war against Prussia, and so reported to
the Emperor. He took no note of the all-powerful
middle class, which rules in constitutional countries.
This class would not hear of becoming allies of
France in a war against Germany.</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the 18th of July, Mr. Washburne
returned to Paris. He had been at Carlsbad
for his health, but on learning the probability of
hostilities, started at once on his return to his post.
We had telegraphed him, but he never received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
telegram. Few private telegrams were forwarded at
all, and none with promptitude, in those days.</p>

<p>Paris now put on its war-paint. The streets were
gay with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pantalon rouge</i>, and all day long the
French drum rat-a-tapped in the streets. The Mobiles
began to arrive, the National Guard to parade&mdash;everywhere
was heard the "Marseillaise." The
forbidden air was delightful to Parisian ears, because
it was forbidden. Long before the end of the siege
it was rarely heard. The Parisians could chant it as
they pleased, so it soon lost its attractions.</p>

<p>The war was popular in Paris. The journals
clamored for it, and the violent republican papers,
whatever they may now say to the contrary, were
among the most blatant. The Emperor, personally,
was opposed to war. He was suffering from the
acute disease which afterward killed him, and was
naturally depressed and despondent. He would
gladly have avoided hostilities, but he was pushed
into them. They persuaded him, too, that the continuance
of his dynasty, the succession of his son, demanded
war; and this was the one ruling motive
which governed both his conduct and that of the
Empress. The Emperor was by no means the omnipotent
potentate he was popularly supposed to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
He was scarcely a free agent. It was his misfortune
to be surrounded by a crowd of adventurers&mdash;French
carpet-baggers. The best men of France, the gentry
of the country, held aloof. The Emperor felt this,
and often tried to reconcile them. Had he reigned
ten years longer, I think that he would have succeeded.
There were signs of relenting. He was
consequently thrown, for his high officers of state,
upon a class of clever adventurers. Look at his last
cabinet before the Revolution of September. One
member was most unenviably known for the loot of
the Summer Palace at Pekin; another is now in Mazas,
convicted of swindling; and a third, it was currently
reported in Paris, received one hundred thousand
francs in the Transcontinental, Memphis, and
El Paso swindle; and I have heard from high Prussian
authority that when the gates of Paris were
opened after the siege, and the Germans sold flour
and cattle and sheep to meet the pressing necessities
of the starving Parisians, of a flock of three
thousand sheep not one was permitted to enter the
city till this gentleman had received two francs a
head.</p>

<p>I have said that the Emperor was scarcely a free
agent. Here is an anecdote in point. Prince Met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>ternich,
the Austrian Embassador, returning from
Vienna, called to pay his respects at the palace. The
Emperor asked him what military news there was
in Austria. He replied that they were arming with
the Remington breech-loader. "The Remington,"
said the Emperor, "what is that? I thought I knew
all the principal breech-loaders, but I never heard of
that." Metternich explained. "Where is Remington?"
said the Emperor. The Prince replied that he
happened to be in Paris. "I wish you would bring
him to me, and do you bring him yourself; this will
insure my seeing him." Metternich brought him.
The Emperor examined his piece, and was much
pleased with it. He wrote a note with his own hand
to the Minister of War, Le Bœuf, and told Remington
to take it at once: of course he was received without
delay. "So, my good friend, you have seen the
Emperor, have you?" "Yes, sir, I had the honor to
see his Majesty." "Well, you won't see him again:"
and he did not. This was the way the Emperor was
served. Le Bœuf was the capable and well-informed
Minister of War who stated in the Assembly that
France was thoroughly prepared for the field&mdash;"not
a button on a gaiter was wanting." When the sad
truth became known, the French wits said that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
statement was literally correct, for there was not a
gaiter in store.</p>

<p>But while the war was popular in Paris, it was not
so in the provinces. After the Revolution broke out,
the Provisional Government found in the Tuileries
a number of important historical documents, and
among them reports from the prefects of the different
departments on this subject. They breathed
one tone. The people wanted peace; but if they
were attacked, if the honor of France were at stake,
they were ready to fight. Considering the source
whence this information came, from imperial prefects,
creatures of the Government, there was no
mistaking the pacific feeling of the country.</p>

<p>And now began our labors at the Legation, increasing
from day to day, until we had thirteen distinct
nationalities under our charge, European and South
American. Nor was this all. The citizens of other
countries&mdash;countries which had not formally asked
our protection&mdash;came to us for assistance. This was
particularly the case with Mexico and Roumania.
There was a large colony of Mexicans in Paris, and
Mexico had no representative in France. The diplomatic
relations which were suspended by the Mexican
war are still unrenewed, notwithstanding the
friendly efforts of our Government. As regards
Roumania, its position is peculiar. Nominally it is
under the suzerainty of Turkey, and the Turk claims
to represent it abroad. But Roumania does not ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>quiesce
in this claim, and appoints its own agents,
who are quasi-recognized by the powers to whom
they are accredited. There was a large number of
Roumanian students in Paris at the outbreak of the
war. These young men were left quite destitute
during the siege. The French Government behaved
very generously by them. At Mr. Washburne's suggestion,
it made them a monthly allowance, sufficient
for their support.</p>

<p>The French Government had at first decided that
no German should leave France to return home.
The reason given for this harsh measure was that
every German was a soldier, and would go to swell
the enemy's ranks. It was very hard on the Germans
in France. They were thrown out of employment,
insulted, liable to violence, and sometimes assaulted,
and, in addition to all this, were treated as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insoumis</i> at home, and subject to severe punishment
for neglect of military duty. Mr. Washburne remonstrated
against this measure, and wrote an able
dispatch to the Duke de Gramont, claiming the right
of the Germans, under all recognized international
law, to leave France if they wished to do so. It was
in vain. But now came a change of ministry. The
Prince de la Tour d'Auvergne became Minister of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Foreign Affairs, and the Government took precisely
the opposite course, and decided to expel the Germans.
Again Mr. Washburne intervened, claiming
that this was as much a violation of international law
as the other course. All he could obtain was, that
the decree should be executed with leniency, and
that liberal exceptions should be made in individual
cases of special hardship. But the French press
called for the expulsion of the Germans, and the
Corps Législatif passed a resolution that they should
be expelled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the decree was published in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal
Officiel</cite>, and placarded on the walls of Paris, they
came in shoals to the Legation. From seven o'clock
in the morning till five in the afternoon, when we
closed the office, they fairly besieged us. Five hundred
often collected in the street at once. We were
compelled, though reluctantly, to ask for the aid of
the police, both as a protection to the Germans
themselves against the mob, and for our own convenience.
We had six gendarmes constantly on
duty. It was almost impossible to get up our own
stairs, and Americans who had business at the Legation
complained of the impossibility of getting in.
I found a side-entrance through a neighbor's apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>ment,
of which I revealed the secret to some of my
countrymen.</p>

<p>The French Government required that every German
leaving Paris should be furnished with a pass
from us. At Mr. Washburne's request they dispensed
with the police <em>visa</em>, and so simplified matters.
But there were forty thousand Germans in
Paris; of these about thirty thousand went away.
Allowing three persons to each pass, for many had
families, we issued about three thousand passes in six
weeks. Many needed assistance to enable them to
leave Paris. The Prussian Government, with great
liberality, put fifty thousand thalers (thirty-seven
thousand five hundred dollars) at our disposition,
and this sum they afterward increased. We gave
those who needed them railroad tickets to the frontier
of Germany and Belgium; there the German
Government took charge of them, or rather a charitable
organization under the presidency of the Empress
Augusta, who showed the most unwearying devotion
in good works during the whole war. Eight
or ten thousand remained in Paris during the siege.
Of those at least one-third came upon the Legation
for support, unwillingly in most cases, and driven by
necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>But while the Germans thus thronged our office,
our own countrymen were not wanting. In six
weeks we issued eleven hundred passports. Allowing
an average of three persons to a passport, thirty-three
hundred Americans passed through Paris in
those six weeks. To these may be added another
thousand who had passports from the State Department.
The question has often been asked me, How
many Americans do you suppose are in Europe? If
to the above forty-three hundred we add seventeen
hundred for those who remained quietly where the
war found them, or procured their passports at other
legations, we have six thousand souls. At that time
this was the average number of our people temporarily
in Europe. There are fewer now.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July the Emperor started for the
seat of war. He took with him his Centgardes and
a numerous staff. Nothing can be worse for an
army than to be encumbered with a large head-quarters
staff. It involves an immense amount of transportation,
blocking up the roads, and interfering
with the march of the troops. Every thing must
give way to head-quarters trains, even supplies for
the soldiers and ammunition for the guns. This
naturally breeds discontent, and interferes with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
efficiency of the army. A staff should consist of the
fewest possible number of working men, and they
should be restricted, like the line, to a limited amount
of baggage. Sherman gave an example of what a
staff should be in this respect, on his famous march
to the sea.</p>

<p>Meantime rumors of disaster came thick and fast
from the front. The French had fought the battle
of Wissembourg with great gallantry, but they were
outnumbered and outgeneraled. Indeed, it was their
misfortune in this war to have no great generals. I
was reminded of our own experience when our war
broke out, and when we appointed to high command
men who had "the Spirit of the Lord, and a disposition
to storm works," which Mr. Stanton then declared
to be all that was necessary. He lived to
change his mind, and to become one of the strongest
advocates of trained military talent. Happily for us,
the war lasted long enough to enable us to sift the
wheat from the chaff. Its close found in high command
the very men best fitted to be there. The
good sense of our rulers and the tenacity of our people
had enabled us to effect this vital change. The
French were not so fortunate. Their generals in
high command when the war broke out were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
equal to the situation, and their armies were defeated
and overwhelmed before the officers of ability, who
were undoubtedly to be found among them, but in
inferior positions, had had the opportunity to show
what was in them. For the system of advancement
under the Empire was not calculated to bring the
best men to the front. I was told during the siege
by General Berthaut, now Minister of War, that an
officer who studied was looked upon as a republican,
and passed over. The road to promotion lay through
the <em>café</em>.</p>

<p>There were bitter rivalries, too, between the corps
commanders. It was stated, I do not know with
what truth, that repeated messages failed to bring
up the supporting corps to MacMahon's assistance.
The same thing had happened at Solferino, where,
as it was alleged, the battle was nearly lost, because
Canrobert would not support Niel. A challenge
passed between them, and nothing but the imperative
intervention of the Emperor prevented the
scandal of a duel.</p>

<p>The defeat at Wissembourg was not published in
Paris till several hours after it had appeared in the
London morning papers. The press was muzzled.
The depression produced was very great. Certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Bourse operators took advantage of the inflammable
state of public opinion. One day a man in the
uniform of a Government courier rode up to the
Bourse, and, calling out his confederate, delivered a
dispatch purporting to come from the front: "Great
victory; total defeat of the Prussians; capture of the
Crown Prince; French army in full march for Berlin!"
Up went stocks. The crowd shouted, sung,
wept for joy, threw themselves into each other's
arms, embraced, and kissed. Popular actors and
singers were recognized as they drove through the
streets, stopped, and compelled to sing or recite the
"Marseillaise." Paris was drunk with joy. Then
came the reaction. The truth was soon known. As
they had been extreme in their joy, they were now
extreme in their grief. They were not only despondent,
they were in despair. As the poor Empress said
at the time to Mr. Washburne, "They have no for-ti-tude."
The crowd collected in the streets, inveighed
against the Government, and, in a pouring rain,
marched to Ollivier's residence, in the Place Vendôme,
and insisted upon his addresing them. Ollivier
was then the head of the Government. He had
not much to say, but he was an eloquent speaker,
and partially pacified them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>But the defeats of the French and their consequent
exasperation reacted upon the Germans under
our protection. Employers discharged their workmen;
those who would gladly have kept them dared
not. They lived in constant dread, and the number
of those thronging to the Legation to obtain the
means of departure increased daily. The suffering,
both moral and physical, was very great. It must
be borne in mind that many of these people had
been settled for years in Paris; that they had married
there; their children had been born and had
married there; their property and their business interests
all lay there. Yet they were pitilessly expelled,
and not only their business interests ruined,
but the dearest family ties dissevered. We have
heard much in history and romance of the expulsion
of the Moors from Spain, and of the Huguenots
from France, and our sympathies are deeply stirred
as we read of the misery endured by those poor exiles.
I do not see why the expulsion of the Germans
does not rank with these touching episodes,
both in the suffering of the victims and the pathos
of their departure.</p>

<p>Of course the French Government did not expel
these poor people with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cœur léger</i>. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
their reasons. They said that in case of siege there
would be additional mouths to feed, and that it
would be a constant source of danger to have so
many Germans residing in their midst. But at that
time a siege was not anticipated; and, except in
this case, there surely could have been no danger in
their stay.</p>

<p>There were touching scenes at the Legation among
the weeping crowd of women. Some left children
and grandchildren married to Frenchmen. Some
were not in a fit condition to travel, but required the
comforts of a home, and tender care. A child was
born upon a bench in the street in front of the Legation.
(It was suggested to name it after a distinguished
American diplomate.) Every thing that energy
and kindness of heart could do to facilitate the
departure of those poor people, and to mitigate its
severity, was done by our minister.</p>

<p>And here let me remark that no one could have
been better fitted for the difficult task he was suddenly
called upon to undertake than Mr. Washburne.
He trusted to the dictates of a sound judgment, a
kind heart, and a fearless temperament; and these
are pretty safe guides in the long run. Had he
been brought up in diplomacy, he would have hesi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>tated
and read up for precedents which did not exist,
and so let the propitious moment pass. The result
of my observation in Europe during ten years
of pretty active service is this: that while there
should be a permanent officer in every embassy&mdash;a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chancellier</i>, as he is called in Paris&mdash;who can turn
promptly to any page of the archives, and is posted
in the history of the relations of the country in
which he resides with his own; who knows the
court ceremonial, and is intimate with the court officials;
in short, "who knows the ropes"&mdash;it is quite
as well that the head of the embassy should be a <em>new</em>
man. He will attach much less importance to trifles,
and act more fearlessly in emergencies. Great Britain
and France have pursued this plan in several
instances lately. The old diplomates grumble, but
it is clearly for the advantage of the country.</p>

<p>News of reverses now poured in upon us, until
they culminated in the great disaster of Sedan.
That this should have been so great a calamity&mdash;a
capitulation instead of a defeat&mdash;appears to have
been the fault of MacMahon. He was compelled by
imperative orders from Paris, and entirely against
his own judgment, to go to the relief of Bazaine,
and to fight against overwhelming odds. But for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the tactical disposition of his forces, by which they
were penned up in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i> from which they had
no line of retreat, he, as commander-in-chief, is apparently
responsible. But the French armies seem
from the beginning to have been badly organized,
badly led, and conscious that they were so, and discouraged
accordingly. I have General Sheridan's authority
for saying that the position of the French at
Sedan was a very strong one; and while it was inevitable
that they should be defeated by superior numbers,
they ought to have held their ground for three
days. I have no doubt that our troops under Sheridan
would have done so. He spoke in the highest
terms of the gallantry of the French cavalry, which
was sacrificed to encourage the infantry. The remark
of a distinguished French general upon the
Charge of the Six Hundred, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est magnifique, mais
ce n'est pas la guerre</i>," would have applied equally
well to the charge of the cuirassiers at Sedan.</p>

<p>Sheridan accompanied the King's head-quarters.
We had asked officially, at the commencement of the
war, that he might be permitted to accompany the
French army, and been refused. The Emperor subsequently
told Dr. Evans that he had never heard
of the application. General orders had been issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that no foreign officer should go with the army; but
there was surely some difference between the application
of an officer for this permission on his own
account, and the request of a friendly Government
that the Lieutenant-General of its armies might be
permitted to accompany the Emperor. The application
probably never got beyond the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef du cabinet</i>
of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Nowhere in
the world is bureaucracy carried to the extent it is
in France. A minister can scarcely appoint a clerk
in his office. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef du bureau</i> is omnipotent in
his own department. The Republic promised to
change all this; but its ministers, after a gallant
effort, have fallen in the struggle, and things move
on in the same old groove.</p>

<p>At the battle of Sedan, Sheridan stood near Count
Bismarck. Toward its close he shut up his glass,
and, turning to Bismarck, said, "The battle is won."
The Count replied that he should be glad to think
so, but saw no signs of it yet. In a minute or two
more the French gave way. Turning his glass toward
Sedan, Sheridan observed, "The Emperor is
there." Bismarck answered that it could not be;
that the Emperor was not such a fool as to place
himself in that situation. Looking again, Sheridan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
said, "He is there, anyhow." He had drawn his
conclusions from the immense staff he saw, and the
confusion reigning among them.</p>

<p>Sheridan was right. The Emperor and his staff
were prisoners of war. The Emperor had behaved
with the greatest personal courage, and subsequently,
when dissensions arose between the French generals
as to who was responsible for the great disaster, he
behaved with the greatest generosity. But he should
not have been at Sedan. The post of usefulness and
of danger for him was at Paris, and not with the
army.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 4th of September, 1870, Paris was
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fête</i>. The Parisians had a new revolution, and
were delighted with it. The whole population had
turned out, men, women, and children, in their holiday
clothes. They filled the beautiful Place de la
Concorde, the finest in the world; they swarmed
across the bridge and into the Palais Bourbon, where
the Corps Législatif was in session. The soldiers
who guarded the imperial legislators melted away,
the cocked hats of the truculent gendarmes vanished
miraculously. The Conscript Fathers did not exactly
imitate the Roman Senators when they too were
invaded by the Gauls, but disappeared as quickly
as the gendarmes. These were the gentlemen who
had howled for war, and called Mr. Thiers traitor
when he pleaded for peace. The people were gay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
good-humored, happy; in short, it was a Sunday fête,
and in half an hour Paris, and consequently France,
was a republic.</p>

<p>From the Palais Bourbon the crowd went to the
Tuileries, where the Empress was awaiting the progress
of events. There was no anger then felt toward
her, and she was not in danger; but a mob,
and especially a French mob, is a capricious creature.
It may be in the gayest of humors; a trifle turns its
mood, and it becomes blood-thirsty as a tiger. The
Empress sent for Trochu, the Governor of Paris.
He had sworn on his faith as a soldier, a Catholic,
and a Breton, to stand by her to the end. He kept
his word by sending an aid-de-camp to her assistance.
Of all the creatures of the court whom the
favor of the Emperor had raised from obscurity, not
one came near her. Jerome Bonaparte&mdash;the American
Bonaparte&mdash;had been Governor of the Palace.
Fortunately he had been appointed to the command
of a regiment of cavalry; for had he still been Governor
there would probably have been a fight, and
it was as well that there should be no bloodshed.
Happily for the Empress, two foreigners remembered
her. The Embassador of Austria and the Minister
of Italy went to her aid. They found every sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of demoralization at the palace, the servants deserting,
and pilfering as they went. They persuaded
her, much against her will, to fly. They traversed the
whole length of the Louvre to the door in the rear.
Metternich opened the door, but, seeing the crowd,
closed it again. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce n'est que l'audace qui sauve</i>,"
said the Empress, and ordered it opened. They
passed into the crowd. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</i> recognized her,
and cried, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Impératrice! l'Impératrice!</i>" "I'll
teach you to cry '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Prusse</i>!'" said Nigra, and
pinched his ear till he howled. Metternich went for
his carriage. While he was gone, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</i> passed,
Nigra hailed it, and the Empress and Madame Le
Breton entered. It was agreed that they should
meet at the house of a noted Bonapartist. She
went there, and was refused admission. She went
to another; he was out of town. In this emergency
she thought of Dr. Evans, her American dentist,
and drove to his residence. He was expecting two
American ladies on a visit to his family, and every
thing was prepared for them. When the servant
announced two ladies, the doctor was at dinner.
Excusing himself to his guests, he went out to receive
them, and found the Empress. The next day
he took her and Madame Le Breton in his carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to Trouville, on the coast, near Havre. There was a
sort of guard kept at the gates of Paris, though not
a very strict one. The doctor said, "You know me,
Dr. Evans. I am taking this poor lady to the asylum
here at Neuilly." They passed, and arrived safely at
Trouville, where the doctor's family were spending
the summer.</p>

<p>In the mean time a little English yacht of fifty
tons was lying in dock at Trouville. Her owner, Sir
John Burgoyne, great-nephew of General Burgoyne,
who commanded the British troops at Saratoga, had
intended to sail that day for England; but at the
suggestion of an American lady, a friend of his
wife's, had decided to remain another day, and make
an excursion to the ruins of the castle of William
the Conqueror. In the evening Dr. Evans went on
board, and stated who he was, and what he had come
for. As soon as he was satisfied that the Empress
was really at Trouville, Sir John said that he
would gladly take her across the Channel, and it was
agreed that she should come on board in the morning,
when the tide served. That evening the gendarmes
visited the yacht, for it was rumored that the
Empress was at Trouville. In the morning she came
on board, and the yacht sailed. The voyage was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rough, and the little vessel was obliged to lie to.
She arrived safely at Hyde, however, and the Empress
proceeded at once to Hastings, where she met
her son. Thus she had escaped by the aid exclusively
of foreigners&mdash;an Austrian and an Italian, an
American and an Englishman.</p>

<p>The new Government, the "National Defense"
they called it&mdash;the French attach great importance
to names&mdash;was duly inaugurated at the Hôtel
de Ville. Had it not been inaugurated there, and
proclaimed from the historic window, the Parisians
would scarcely have looked upon it as a legitimate
Government. General Trochu was placed at its
head, and Jules Favre made Minister of Foreign
Affairs. The appointment of Trochu was unfortunate.
He was an honorable man, intelligent, a student,
and a good military critic, but utterly valueless
in active service. He coddled the mob, treating
them as if they were the purest of patriots; whereas
they were the marplots of the Defense. He was selected
probably because he was the only Republican
among the French generals of prominence, and not
for any peculiar fitness for command in those troublous
times.</p>

<p>Shortly after the inauguration of the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of the National Defense, Mr. Washburne had occasion
to go to the Hôtel de Ville. Jules Simon, now
Minister of the Interior, seized the opportunity to
make us an oration. What particular object he had
in view, unless it were to convince the Minister of
the United States that Jules Simon was a great orator,
I have been unable to discover. If that was his
object, he succeeded. Whether it was worth while
to occupy his and our valuable time for this purpose
only, may be doubted.</p>

<p>On the 7th of September came our instructions to
recognize the Republic if it seemed to us to be firmly
established. Mr. Washburne sent me to make
an appointment with Jules Favre. It was made for
that afternoon. While Washburne prepared his address,
I read up in the archives of the Legation to
learn what was done under similar circumstances in
1848. I found that we had been the first to recognize
the Republic at that date, but that Lamartine,
in his report, had taken no notice of the fact, for
fear, it was said, of wounding the susceptibilities of
Great Britain. Washburne told me to mention this
circumstance to Favre: he did not intend that we
should be ignored a second time, if he could prevent
it. I mentioned it to Favre, and he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
substantially, that Great Britain had not treated
France so well that they need have any particular
anxiety about wounding her susceptibilities; and
added that Great Britain was now of very little
consequence.</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne's address was an admirable document.
Favre replied to it very happily. He said
that the recognition of the "young Republic" by
the United States was a "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand appui</i>;" that he
"felt gratitude and profound emotion." Jules Favre
is a master of the French language. It is a
great treat to hear him, even in ordinary conversation,
roll out in a charming voice and impressive
manner the most perfectly harmonious words of
that beautiful language. French does not rise to
the sublimity of poetry. Shakspeare is absurd in
French. But for charm in conversation, and precision
in science, it is simply perfect.</p>

<p>The next day the interview was reported in full
in the <cite>Officiel</cite>. Washburne's address was very well
translated, except where he quoted from the Declaration
of Independence, and spoke of the right of every
man to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
Here the translator had made him say that
every man had a right "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de vivre en travaillant au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
bonheur de tous</i>." Rather a liberal translation, and
thoroughly French both in language and sentiment.
But I have not remarked that the French Republicans
labor more for the happiness of their neighbors
than other nationalities, or than their own countrymen.
If there be a political party in France
which does more in charities than another, it is the
Orleanist.</p>

<p>Favre was very anxious that Mr. Washburne
should intervene to make peace. When he found
that under our instructions we could not join with
other European powers in political matters purely
European (advice left us by Washington, and wisely
followed by Mr. Fish), he begged Mr. Washburne to
intervene in his private capacity. But he replied
very sensibly that it was impossible for him to separate
his private from his public capacity; he must
always be the Minister of the United States.</p>

<p>But what Washburne felt compelled to decline,
another American gentleman, Mr. O'Sullivan, formerly
our Minister at Lisbon, undertook. He asked
Mr. Washburne for a letter to Bismarck, but this he
did not feel authorized to give. He then begged for
a letter of introduction to Sheridan, who was at the
King's head-quarters. This he received. Jules Fa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>vre,
who clutched eagerly at any thing that might
possibly lead to peace, gave him a safe-conduct, and
he started for the Prussian lines. But he never got
to head-quarters. That long-headed Bismarck had
anticipated some such outside benevolent efforts, and
had given orders to the outlying corps that if any
distinguished gentlemen came along desiring to make
peace, they should be treated with all possible courtesy,
but not allowed to approach head-quarters without
permission of the King. O'Sullivan was stopped,
and his letter forwarded to Sheridan. Bismarck
sent for the General, and asked if he knew
O'Sullivan. He said he did not. He then asked if
he was anxious to see him. Sheridan replied that
he should be happy to make his acquaintance, but
that he saw no pressing haste in the matter. "Then
he sha'n't come," said Bismarck; and O'Sullivan returned
to Paris. But the French did not treat him
so well as the Germans. As he approached Paris,
walking quietly along the high-road, a carpet-bag in
one hand and an umbrella in the other, a detachment
of the vigilant National Guard rushed across a field
and covered him with their loaded pieces. As he
made no resistance, they simply took from him his
bag and umbrella, and led him before their com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>mander
blindfolded. That officer sent him under
guard to one of those wretched dens scooped out of
the barrier where they sometimes confined smugglers
temporarily, but which were oftener used for
more unsavory purposes. There they kept him all
night. In the morning Jules Favre sent to his assistance,
and he was released.</p>

<p>O'Sullivan afterward left Paris in the general exodus
of Americans. He went, as they did, to Versailles;
but he staid there some three weeks, talking
peace to the German princes quartered at the Hôtel
des Réservoirs, some of whom he had previously
known. He had a plan, not at all a bad one in itself,
but under the circumstances entirely impracticable.
It was to neutralize a strip of territory lying
between France and Germany, annex part of it to
Belgium, and part to Switzerland, and put it under
the protection of the Great Powers. One evening
O'Sullivan dined with the Crown Prince. He sat
next to Bismarck, and discoursed upon his pet neutral-strip
theory. As they parted, Bismarck shook
his hand, and said that he was charmed to make his
acquaintance. "But, Mr. O'Sullivan, a curious thing
sometimes happens to me: I make the acquaintance
of a most agreeable gentleman in the afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in the evening I find myself reluctantly compelled
to order him out of Versailles." O'Sullivan mentioned
this to friends he was visiting in the evening,
but did not see its application to himself. They did,
however. He went to his hotel, and found a Prussian
officer at his door with orders for him to leave
Versailles that night. He remonstrated, and it was
finally agreed that he should start at eight o'clock in
the morning. A sentry was placed at the bedroom
door, who thought that a proper discharge of his
duty required him to open it every five minutes
during the night, to make sure that his prisoner
had not escaped. Mrs. O'Sullivan did not quite appreciate
the situation.</p>

<p>Belleville now began a series of patriotic demonstrations
at the Legation, which soon became a nuisance.
When I first heard the drum and fife coming
up the Rue Chaillot, and several respectable-looking
citizens came in and inquired for Mr. Washburne,
I was quite impressed with the interest of the
occasion. Washburne went out upon the balcony
and made them a speech, and thanked them for this
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démonstration patriotique</i>. But when they began
to come daily, and the rag, tag, and bobtail at that,
and day after day Washburne was called out to
thank them for this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démonstration patriotique</i>, I
got very heartily sick of it. We were too busy to
have our time wasted in this way. But as the siege
progressed, and we did our duty in protecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Germans, as we received news from the outside
when others did not, and that news was uniformly
unfavorable to the French, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démonstrations patriotiques</i>
ceased; and it was only a fear of the law,
and that "divinity that doth hedge in a" diplomate,
that prevented our receiving a demonstration of a
very different sort.</p>

<p>For the clubs were now rampant, another bane of
the Defense. Had they been suppressed at the beginning,
as they were at the end, of the siege by
General Vinoy, the result might have been different.
Their orators advocated the wildest and most
destructive theories amidst the applause of a congenial
audience. Blasphemy was received with special
favor. I remember once, however, the orator seasoned
his discourse too high even for that audience.
He said he "would like to scale heaven, and collar
[<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empoigner</i>] the Deity." It was the day of balloons,
and a wag in the audience called out, "Why don't
you go up in a balloon?" This turned the laugh
upon the orator, and he disappeared, for in Paris
ridicule kills.</p>

<p>A curious and annoying feature in the Parisian
character during the war was the unreasoning and
unreasonable suspicion of the population. A gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>tleman
from Philadelphia interested in Fairmount
Park, which was then just opened, was struck with
the beauty of the gates at the entrance to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</i>
on the Avenue de l'Impératrice&mdash;Avenue du Bois
de Boulogne they call it now, certainly not a change
for the better, for it was a beautiful avenue, appropriately
named after a beautiful woman. Our Philadelphia
friend called his daughter's attention to the
gates, remarking that they would be appropriate at
Fairmount, and took out his note-book to sketch
them. He was at once surrounded by a mob, he and
his daughter arrested, and hurried before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maire</i>
of the arrondissement. They said he was a Prussian
spy, and was sketching the fortifications. He explained
who he was, and what he was doing, and offered
the drawing in proof. There were the gates
to speak for themselves, but this was no evidence to
them. Mr. Justice Shallow insisted that he must
be a spy. Happily for him, the mayor's clerk was a
sensible man, and spoke a little English, and through
his instrumentality our friend was discharged.</p>

<p>I have seen a mob collect about a gentleman who
took from his pocket a piece of paper and a pencil
to write down an address. I knew an American
friend to be arrested, mistaken for Mr. Schneider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
formerly President of the Corps Législatif. My
man was dark, and Schneider was fair; but that
made no difference. During the petroleum madness,
immediately after the suppression of the Commune,
an American lady was followed to her home
and very nearly maltreated because she had a bottle
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur d'orange</i> in her hand, which she had just
bought at the druggist's. Our vice-consul had red
curtains in his sitting-room. One evening he was
disagreeably surprised by a visit of armed National
Guards. They accused him of making signals to the
enemy. On seeing the red curtains, they became
satisfied. That a five-story house on the opposite
side of a narrow street must effectually preclude his
lights from being seen at a distance, was no answer
to them. Mr. Washburne called the attention of the
French Government to this outrage; but, as no
harm had been done, we could not follow the matter
up. Under our consular convention with France, a
consul's house is inviolable; but a vice-consul has
no official existence when the consul is present.
When he is absent, his deputy succeeds to his privileges
and immunities as consular representative of
the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne was not the man to submit to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
outrage upon German or American property. A
squad of National Guards entered and partially pillaged
the house of the German school-master Hedler,
where Washburne's son and other American boys
were at school. Our Minister was in arms at once.
The Government apologized, the battalion was paraded
under arms, the Chief of Police made them a
speech, the guilty men were called out and punished,
and full damages were paid to Hedler, assessed to
Mr. Washburne's satisfaction.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative. On the 18th of September,
several of the principal members of the diplomatic
corps left Paris. Their departure gave rise to
a good deal of discussion, and much has been written
and said upon the subject. The diplomatic corps,
as a body, never left Paris. A few days before the
siege, Lord Lyons called upon Jules Favre. Favre
suggested that if the diplomatic corps wished to
leave Paris&mdash;and it was natural that they should&mdash;he
was prepared to accompany them. Lord Lyons replied
that he saw no necessity for departure at that
time. Favre thereupon said that, in this case, he
should stay too.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, Prince Metternich,
the Austrian Embassador, came very early to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
British Embassy, and said that he meant to go away
that afternoon in company with the Turkish Embassador
and the Italian Minister, and hoped that Lord
Lyons would accompany them. Lord Lyons replied
that he saw no necessity for haste, for Bismarck
would let them go at any time. Metternich answered,
"I don't want to ask any favors of Bismarck, and
my Government doesn't want me to." Lord Lyons
then finding that the Great Powers of Europe had
left, or were about to leave, Paris, consented to go
too, and called again upon Favre. But Favre told
him that he had then made his arrangements to stay;
but that he should send Count Chaudordy to represent
his department at Tours.</p>

<p>As soon as it was known that the representatives
of several of the Great Powers had left Paris, a
meeting of the corps was called by the Nuncio, at
the request of several of its members. The question
was put, Shall the diplomatic corps leave Paris? and
decided in the negative.</p>

<p>But the members departed one by one, till but a
few were left. Another meeting was then called,
and again it was decided not to leave Paris.</p>

<p>It is quite generally supposed that Mr. Washburne
was the only Minister who remained during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
whole siege. This is incorrect. There were six in
all&mdash;the representatives of Northern powers&mdash;Norway
and Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland,
and the United States. In their relations to
the French Government, and in their correspondence
with Count Bismarck upon their right to communicate
with their respective governments during the
siege, and to due notice in case of proposed bombardment,
these gentlemen acted in unison as the
diplomatic corps at Paris.</p>

<p>The division of diplomatic representatives into
embassadors and ministers appears to me to be a
mistake. It is certainly pleasant for the embassadors.
They have the right of direct communication
with the sovereign, for they are held to represent
the person of their own sovereign, which the ministers
do not. At Paris, at the court festivities, they
occupied arm-chairs by the side of the Emperor
and Empress, while the ministers were seated on
benches in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loge</i>. They had precedence on the reception-days
of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. A
minister might have waited two hours; an embassador
dropped in, and entered before him. Some of
them, like Lord Lyons, did not abuse this privilege.
He transacted his business as quickly as possible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
gave place to another. The Turkish Embassador, on
the other hand, used to gossip by the hour. That he
kept a dozen of his colleagues waiting seemed rather
to please him. I once heard Lord Lyons remonstrate
with him for doing so, and he giggled as if
he thought it rather a good joke. In Prussia this is
not permitted: first come, first served, is the rule at
Berlin, and it seems to me to be the just one. Mr.
Bancroft got this rule established, and deserves great
credit for the stout fight he made on the occasion.
Count Bismarck is stated to have said that if there
had been no embassadors, there would have been no
war; for the French Government could not have invented
the story that their Embassador had been insulted
by the King. However this may be, there
can be no doubt that the system leads to the formation
of cliques, and, consequently, to separate action
by a clique instead of by the whole corps. This is
bad under any circumstances, but particularly unfortunate
in great emergencies.</p>

<p>In regard to the right of free communication with
their respective governments claimed by the diplomatic
corps at Paris, Count Bismarck refused to accord
it. He argued that if these gentlemen saw fit
to shut themselves up in a besieged place when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
could go away for the asking, and when the French
Government had made provision for this case by establishing
a branch of the Government at Tours,
they must take the consequences; but as a favor he
would permit correspondence if it were left unsealed.
Of course the corps declined these terms.
To Mr. Washburne he wrote (and Bismarck writes
and speaks admirable English) that his position
as protector of the North Germans in France entitled
him to a different answer; that as an evidence
of his gratitude for the fidelity and energy
with which the duties of this position had been discharged,
it had given him great pleasure to obtain
from the King permission for Mr. Washburne to receive
a sealed bag containing his dispatches and his
private correspondence as often as military necessities
would permit.</p>

<p>There has been much difference of opinion expressed
as to the right of a diplomatic body voluntarily
remaining in a besieged place to receive and
answer dispatches in sealed correspondence. Mr.
Washburne contended that they had such a right;
and in this he was energetically supported by Mr.
Fish. I confess, however, that to my mind the
right is by no means clear. To me Bismarck's ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>gument
is unanswerable. "You see fit to stay when
the Great Powers of Europe have gone, and when
the French Government has made arrangements for
the due discharge of your duties elsewhere. By so
doing you put yourselves in the position of other
inhabitants of the besieged place, and can claim no
privileges not accorded to them." In the case of Mr.
Washburne, charged with the protection of the Germans
at the request of the German Government itself,
the necessity for remaining at Paris may have
existed. At all events, if he thought that it did, it
did not lie in the mouth of that Government to say
that it did not. By choosing as their agent the representative
of a friendly and independent power,
they left his judgment unfettered as to the manner
of discharging his duties. The same remark applies
to M. Kern, the Minister of Switzerland, who was
charged with the protection of the Bavarians and
the Badois. But as regards the other gentlemen, I
can not but agree with Count Bismarck. I was confirmed
in this view, after the siege was over, by General
Sheridan. Dining at my table one day in company
with Mr. Washburne, he said to him, "If I had
been in Moltke's place, you would not have had your
bag."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The siege commenced on the 19th of September.
For some days previous the streets of Paris had presented
an unwonted and curious appearance. They
were thronged with the quaintest-looking old carts,
farm-wagons, Noah's arks of every kind, loaded with
the furniture of the poor inhabitants of the neighborhood
flying to Paris for safety. On the other
hand, the stations were thronged with the carriages
of the better classes leaving the city. The railroads
were so overworked that they finally refused to take
any baggage that could not be carried by the passenger
himself. Imagine the painful situation of some
of our fair countrywomen, Worth's admirers and patrons!
To have come to Paris amidst all the dangers
of war to procure something to wear, to have
procured it, and then to be unable to carry it away!
But what will not woman's wit and energy do under
such circumstances? A clever and energetic friend
of mine hired a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bateau-mouche</i>, one of the little
steamers that ply on the Seine from one part of
Paris to another, and, embarking with her "impedimenta,"
sailed triumphantly for Havre.</p>

<p>It had been agreed between Mr. Washburne and
myself that if the diplomatic corps left Paris, and
he accompanied them, I should remain to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
charge of the Legation, and look after American and
German property; and he so reported to Mr. Fish.
I had quite a curiosity to be a besieged. I had been
a besieger at Port Hudson, and thought that I would
like to experience the other sensation. The sensation
is not an unpleasant one, especially in a city
like Paris. If you have been overworked and harassed,
the relief is very great. There is a calm, a
sort of Sunday rest, about it that is quite delightful.
In my experience the life of the besieged is altogether
the most comfortable of the two. You live
quietly in your own house, and with your own servants;
and with a little forethought you may be amply
provisioned. You sleep in your own room, instead
of in a cold, damp, and muddy tent; and if
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat d'obus</i>&mdash;as the French delicately call it&mdash;strikes
your house on one side, you move into the
other. There has been a great deal of fine writing
about famous sieges, and the suffering and heroism
of the inhabitants. I imagine that there was not so
much suffering, after all, at Saragossa; and that the
"Maid" and her companions in arms had plenty of
corn-meal and good mule-meat to eat&mdash;not a disagreeable
or unwholesome diet for a while!</p>

<p>At the beginning of the siege, one of the absorbing
topics of discussion among the Parisians was the
means of communication with the outer world. The
French had always had a fancy for ballooning, and
were probably in advance of the rest of the world in
this respect. They now applied their experience to
a practical use, and soon a service of mail balloons
was organized, starting from Paris twice a week.
At first they were dispatched in the afternoon, for
the all-sufficient reason that they always had been
dispatched in the afternoon; but soon they found
that the balloon did not rise quickly enough to escape
the bullets of the Prussians encamped upon the
hills which surround Paris. So they changed the
hour of departure to one in the morning. When
daylight appeared they were beyond the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
lines. Indeed, the speed of the balloon is sometimes
marvelous. Starting at one o'clock in the morning,
one of them fell into the sea off the coast of Holland
at daylight. The passengers were rescued by a fishing-smack.
A second descended in Norway on the
very morning it left Paris. The officer of the Post-office
who was charged with the organization of
this service told me that, of ninety-seven balloons
that left Paris during the siege, ninety-four arrived
safely; about equal to railway-trains in these latter
days. Two fell into the hands of the enemy, and
one was never heard of. It was supposed to have
drifted out to sea and been lost. A balloon was
seen off Eddystone Light-house. A few days afterward
a gentleman spending the winter at Torquay
received a letter from the rector at Land's End,
Cornwall, stating that a number of letters had drifted
ashore, supposed to have been lost from a balloon,
and among them was one addressed to him; that it
had been dried, and on receipt of twopence it would
be sent him. It proved to be a balloon letter from
me, and is still preserved as a souvenir of the siege
and the sea.</p>

<p>Quite at the beginning of the siege a member of
my own family received a letter from me, dispatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>ed
by the first balloon which left Paris. Its arrival
created quite a sensation in the little Welsh watering-place
where she was spending a part of the autumn.
People stopped her in the street, and asked
to see the "balloon letter." The natives evidently
thought that it must have something of the balloon
about it.</p>

<p>I recollect Worth's coming to the Legation one
day&mdash;(and who does not know Worth? He rules
the women throughout the civilized and toileted
world; and through the women he rules the men, or
their pockets at least). Worth was in great distress.
His nephew had gone out in a balloon and been captured,
and there were rumors that his life was in
danger. I promised to ascertain his fate, if possible,
and prepared a letter to Count Bismarck, which Mr.
Washburne signed. Bismarck replied most promptly,
as he always did. And here let me state that
during the siege, at the request of anxious wives and
parents, we often addressed inquiries to German
Head-quarters to ascertain the fate of a husband or
a son, and that these inquiries always received the
promptest and kindest attention. To the inquiry
about young Worth, Bismarck replied that he had
been captured attempting to cross the Prussian lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in a balloon; that to cross the Prussian lines in the
air was like crossing them on the land; and that the
person caught attempting it would be similarly punished;
that young Worth was in prison, and would
be kept there for a few months, to teach others not
to attempt the same thing; but that no other harm
had happened, or would happen, to him. I sent for
Worth, and read him the letter. He was much relieved,
and expressed himself very grateful. Some
years later a relative of mine took the material for
a dress to Worth, and asked him to make it up.
Think of the audacity of such a request! But
Worth did it. If gratitude is to be measured not
by the magnitude of the favor conferred, but by the
sacrifice made by him who confers it, then Worth's
gratitude stands out in unequaled grandeur.</p>

<p>But while with the help of balloons the Parisians
managed very well to send letters from Paris, it was
no easy task to receive them. The pigeon experiment
proved a failure. No doubt pigeons can be
trained to do their work tolerably well, and the
French Government now has a large collection of
carriers at the Jardin d'Acclimatation. But during
the siege very few succeeded in reaching home. A
carrier will scarcely ever make a two days' journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
If night overtakes him, he goes astray, misled perhaps
by siren wood-pigeons. In winter, too, the
days are short, snow-storms blind him, and hawks
pounce upon him. One of the canards circulated in
Paris was that the Prussians trained hawks for this
purpose. The instinct of the animal, too, seems to
teach it to fly northward only. Two or three times
a carrier arrived safely, bringing with it one of those
marvels of scientific skill, a photographic letter.
The microscope revealed the contents of a good-sized
newspaper transferred to a scrap of paper that a pigeon
could carry under its wing.</p>

<p>Some of the French residing in London took advantage
of the "agony column" of the <cite>Times</cite> to
send news to their friends. They had faith in the
ubiquity of the great journal, and their faith was rewarded.
I doubt if you could so hedge in a city
that the <cite>Times</cite> would not penetrate it. Our Legation
in London sent it to us. I received one number
a week. In it I found multitudes of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prières</i> addressed
to Mr. Washburne, and some to myself, begging
us to inform Mr. So-and-so, or Madame Blank,
that their wife, or husband, or children, were at such
and such a place, and all well. When these messages
were purely personal, we delivered them. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
they were in cipher, or susceptible of a double meaning,
we did not. I remember finding a message in
cipher, and addressed to the Minister of War. I not
only did not deliver it, but I burned it for fear that
the favor of receiving our letters and papers accorded
us by the German Government might be abused.
About two days before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jour de l'an</i>, I received a
<cite>Times</cite> of December 23d, for the Germans purposely
delayed our bag, probably that the news, should
it become known to the French Government, might
not be acted on by it, to the detriment of German
military operations. The "agony column" was full
of messages to besieged relatives. I thought that the
Parisians could receive no more acceptable presents
for their New-year's-day, so I copied all the messages
which had addresses and sent them by mail.
But some had no addresses. How the writers ever
expected them to reach their destinations, I do not
understand. I copied them too, however, and sent
them to the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gaulois</cite>. On New-year's morning that
journal published them. In a few days it received
grateful letters, thanking the editors warmly, and
offering to pay a share of the expense, "which must
have been great." The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gaulois</cite> replied, declining
all payment, but modestly assuming great credit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
itself for its "unparalleled enterprise," and assuring
its correspondents that it should continue to spare
no expense to procure them news of their families.</p>

<p>The Prussian officers, too, at head-quarters not unfrequently
sent in letters, with the request that we
would distribute them. I remember once receiving
from Count Solms, who had been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i>
at Paris after the departure of the Embassador, a
letter forwarded by him, without address, without
signature, and without date. I waited a few days,
thinking that other letters might refer to it, and that
the owner would call and claim it. No one came.
As the difficulties increased, of course I was the
more determined to trace out the owner. Every
thing else failing, I read the letter, to try to obtain
a clue. Fortunately, I found the name of Mr. Henri
Blount. I knew Mr. Blount, and knew that his
father was in Paris. I wrote him, and told him the
circumstances. He replied that if I would trust him
with the letter, he thought that he could find the
owner. He took it to the Jockey Club at dinner-time,
and asked if there was any gentleman there
whose name was Charles, and whose wife's name was
Anna. A gentleman immediately claimed it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
after a glance reluctantly gave it up. Another
claimed it, and turned out to be the right man.</p>

<p>I had rather an amusing correspondence with
Count Solms in reference to this letter and other
matters. I give two or three of the letters which
passed between us, as showing that we contrived to
enjoy ourselves after a fashion in Paris, notwithstanding
the rigors of the siege. I give the letters
as written. One of them is, perhaps, better adapted
to the French language than to its more austere sister
English.</p>

<p class="p1">To be in exclusive receipt of news during a siege
is gratifying to one's vanity, but it has its decidedly
disagreeable side. I doubt if the siege were to begin
again if Mr. Washburne would accept a bag containing
any thing but his official dispatches and his
family letters. If we gave the Parisians news, they
said that we gave them only bad news. If we with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>held
it, they said that we were withholding the news
of French victories. I speak of what was said in
the workmen's clubs, and by the inferior press; the
better classes and the more respectable newspapers
found no fault. Then General Moltke complained
that we abused our privilege. His scouts had intercepted
a balloon letter, in which the writer spoke
of the facility of receiving letters through the Legation,
and instructed her correspondent to write under
cover to me. That clever writer, too, Labouchère,
"The Besieged Resident," told in the columns of
the <cite>Daily News</cite> how small a matter it was to be
shut up in Paris. "Go to the Legation of the
United States on any day, and there you find the
latest London journals lying on the table." All this
was nuts to General Moltke, for he had opposed our
receiving our bag, but had been overruled by the
King on the request of Count Bismarck. Bismarck
wrote to Mr. Washburne, calling his attention to
Moltke's complaint. Washburne replied. After
stating the circumstances under which I had authorized
a letter to be sent under cover to me, for an
American lady whose daughter was sick with the
small-pox at Brussels, he proceeded to say that both
he and I had endeavored honorably to discharge our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
duties as neutrals; that we had acted according to
the best of our judgments under this sense of duty;
that we proposed to continue to act as we had done;
and that if the German authorities could not trust
us, they had better stop the bag altogether, with the
exception, of course, of the dispatches from our Government.
At the same time he sent back nearly five
hundred letters which had been sent us without authority,
and which had not been delivered, as the
best possible proof that he had not abused his privilege.
Washburne's letter concluded as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Before closing this communication, I trust your
Excellency will pardon me a further observation.
For the period of six months I have been charged
with the delicate, laborious, and responsible duty of
protecting your countrymen in Paris. Of the manner
in which these duties, having relation to both
belligerents, have been performed, I do not propose
to speak. I am content to abide by the record made
up in the State Department at Washington. But I
can state that there has never been a time when
these duties have involved graver consequences and
responsibilities than at the present moment. As I
have expressed to you before, I have been astonished
at the number of Germans who, as it turns out, were
left in the city when the gates were closed. Having
exhausted their last resources, and finding themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in a state of the most absolute destitution, they have
applied to me for protection and aid, which I have
so far been enabled to extend to them from the
funds placed in my hands by the Royal Government.
The number of these people amounts to-day
to two thousand three hundred and eighty-five; and
it is certain, had there not been some one to protect
and aid them, many must have inevitably perished
of cold and starvation. My position in relation to
these people and to your Government is known to
the people of Paris, and as the siege wears on, and
the exasperation is intensified, I now find myself exposed
to the hostility of a certain portion of the population
of the city. While your military authorities
seem to be agitated by the gravest fears in relation
to my dispatch-bag, I am daily violently assailed by
a portion of the Paris press as a "Prussian representative"
and a "Prussian sympathizer;" and a short
time since it was proposed in one of the clubs that I
should be hanged&mdash;rather a pleasant diversion in these
dreary days of siege through which we are passing.</p>

<p>"I will only add that, so long as I am the diplomatic
representative of my country in Paris, I shall
discharge every duty, even to the end, and in the
face of every circumstance, that I owe to my own
Government, and every duty that I have by its direction
assumed toward the subjects of the North
German Confederation.</p>

<p>"I have the honor, etc., etc."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Bismarck replied with an apology. He said he
knew that the privilege accorded us had not been
abused, and he was satisfied that it would not be;
that the military authorities had called his attention
to this matter, and that it was therefore his duty to
call Mr. Washburne's attention to it; that the bag
would continue to be sent as usual; and that he returned
the five hundred letters, with full authority
to Mr. Washburne to deliver them if he saw fit. I
heard afterward that Bismarck was delighted with
Washburne's letter, and took special pleasure in
sending a copy to General Moltke.</p>

<p>Early in the month of October we were surprised
by a visit from General Burnside. He happened to
be at Versailles, more from curiosity than any other
motive, where, through General Sheridan, he became
quite intimate with Count Bismarck. Bismarck
asked him one day if he would like to go into Paris
on a peace mission. Lord Granville had been very
urgent with the King to grant the French an armistice,
and had induced him to offer it, with a view to
an election. There would be no difficulty, Bismarck
said, on any point except that of revictualment.
This General Moltke would not hear of. Not an
ounce of food should enter Paris. "Now," said Bismarck,
"that Government of the National Defense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
is not the wisest in the world, but they are not such
d&mdash;d fools as to stand out on a point like that.
There will be an armistice, and an armistice means
peace. If there is peace, England will get the credit
of it; and as the United States represents us, I
would rather that you had the credit of it." Burnside
came in accordingly, accompanied by Mr. Paul
Forbes, who was promoted to the rank of aid-de-camp
for the occasion, and dubbed a colonel. The
Prussians could not realize the idea of a general
traveling without his aid. A meeting was appointed
with Trochu, and I went as interpreter. His headquarters
were at the Louvre, in a large and convenient
apartment, occupied, under the Empire, by M.
Rouher. Before Burnside had stated the object of
his visit, Trochu made us a speech. He spoke well
for nearly half an hour. He told us that France
had been very wicked; that she had fallen away
from the true Catholic faith; that infidelity and
skepticism were rampant in the land; that the misfortunes
which had come upon her were deserved;
that they were visitations for the sins of the people;
but that, when they had repented and humbled
themselves, he had faith that the punishment would
pass from them. He continued in this strain for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
full twenty minutes, speaking very eloquently; then
pulled out his handkerchief, and saying, "Excuse
my emotion," he wept. After this he came to business.
Burnside confined himself most conscientiously
to the exact tenor of his message. Trochu made
repeated suggestions of such and such possibilities,
but Burnside refused to follow him. He knew
nothing but his instructions. As I had feared,
Trochu bristled up at the no-revictualment clause.
"Such a condition had never been heard of. From
the most remote antiquity, there had always been
revictualment allowed in case of armistice, so much
per head per diem." He gave us at that time no
positive answer, but said he would discuss the matter
with his colleagues. Negotiations failed upon
this very point. The French Government called it
a point of honor. It was rather a point of vanity.
We did not need the provisions, as the result showed
we had food enough for three months. Yet, for that
barren privilege of bringing in food which was not
needed, the Government of the National Defense
rejected the armistice. They could then have made
peace, with the loss of one province and two milliards.
They continued the war, and lost two provinces and
five milliards (one thousand millions of dollars).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that the members of the
Government of the National Defense were self-appointed.
They were always preaching of their earnest
desire to appeal to the people. Here was the
opportunity, and they rejected it. It is a pleasant
thing to appoint yourself and your particular friends
rulers of a great country like France, and one does
not readily resign the position. The people might
not re-appoint you.</p>

<p>As we left the Louvre, I said to Burnside, "If
France is to be saved, it will not be by that man."
"I don't know that&mdash;I don't know that," he replied.
He was evidently impressed by Trochu's eloquence
and emotion, and ready tear.</p>

<p>It has been stated that Bismarck refused to enter
into negotiations with the Government of the
National Defense; that he would not recognize its
self-assumed authority, and considered that there
was no evidence that it was recognized by the majority
of the French people; for there were riots in
the great cities of the South, and disturbances in
Brittany. Bismarck recognized it or not, as suited
his policy, and that policy was exclusively the interests
of Germany. Had Trochu waived the food
question, Bismarck would have promptly recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
him and his colleagues, so far, at least, as to make
an armistice with them, as he afterward did.</p>

<p>Burnside returned that afternoon to Versailles. I
accompanied him as far as Sèvres. Trochu sent a
carriage for us. It was odd to find one's self in one
of the old imperial barouches, drawn by the famous
post-horses of the Emperor. We drove through the
Bois by Rothschild's house, and so to the broken
bridge at Sèvres. In the Bois desolation reigned.
The trees were cut down within three hundred yards
of the ramparts, the roads torn up and torpedoes
planted in them. The swans had gone to feed the
hungry soldiers, and the ducks, to avoid the same
fate, kept wisely out in the middle of the lake.
When we had reached the bridge, a bugle sounded
on the French side, and a white flag was displayed.
It was soon answered from the German side, and a
similar flag was raised. At once the French troops
lounged from under cover, their hands in their pockets,
and down to the water's edge. The Prussians
were kept concealed. They saw us, no doubt, but
not one of them was to be seen. Presently, a Prussian
officer descended the street, followed by a flag-bearer.
He stalks across the bridge to the broken
arch, turns, takes the flag from the bearer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
plants the staff in the bridge, with an air as if to
say "Touch that, if you dare." The French soldiers
are evidently impressed. They mutter, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voici des
militaires</i>." The officer asks in French, "Are those
the American generals?" "They are." "Then let
them pass." Burnside requests permission to take
Antoine with him, the messenger of the Legation.
"Is he an American?" "Yes." "Then he can
come, of course." The steam-launch puffs up, and
the party cross. I cross with them, but return at
once to the French side. The soldiers disappear,
the flag is lowered, and the firing recommences. I
have been rather minute in this description, as the
same ceremonies were observed twice a week, when
we sent and received our dispatch-bags.</p>

<p>The German Government complained on several
occasions of the violation of flags of truce. These
complaints were addressed to the French authorities
through us. Indeed, every communication addressed
to the French Government and its replies were
sent through the Legation. This kept us busy even
during the quiet days of the siege. The violation of
parole was another fruitful source of correspondence.
The Germans sent us a list of over twenty-five officers,
whom they alleged had broken their paroles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
In some cases&mdash;that of General Ducrot, for instance&mdash;there
are two sides to the question. He claimed
that it was a legitimate escape, and the French press
was unanimously of his opinion. There was another
branch of correspondence that occupied a good deal
of our time. The two governments, to their credit
be it spoken, did not allow the war to interfere with
the administration of justice. Under their treaties
each Government was bound to serve upon its own
subjects all legal documents in civil suits emanating
from the courts of the other. This was done
throughout the war, and they all passed through our
hands.</p>

<p>There was, too, correspondence between the two
hostile governments upon other subjects. Among
them I recollect one in relation to the Francs-Tireurs.
The Germans treated these irregulars as guerrillas.
The French remonstrated. The Germans answered
that they had no uniform; that they wore the blue
blouse, which is the national dress of the French
peasant; and that they ought to wear something
which could be distinguished at rifle range. I do
not remember how the matter was settled, but I believe
that the Francs-Tireurs gradually disappeared,
absorbed in the Mobiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after Burnside's mission I paid a second
visit to Trochu. Mr. Washburne had applied to the
Germans for permission for Americans and other
foreigners to leave Paris. The King accorded it at
once. Any American could leave on Mr. Washburne's
pass, any other foreigner on the same pass,
provided that his name had first been submitted to
and accepted by the German authorities. Having
obtained this concession, Mr. Washburne next applied
to the French Government for its permission. To his
surprise, it was refused. He could not understand
it. That the Germans should wish to keep in the
city a number of "useless mouths" to help consume
the provision, was natural, but that the French, who,
for the same reason, ought to have wished to get rid
of them, should refuse to let them go, was inconceivable.
But Washburne was not the man to sit down
quietly under a refusal in a matter like this. He insisted
that they must go, and should go. Favre was
evidently on his side, and we had reason to believe
that he was backed by some, at least, of his colleagues.
Trochu opposed the departure for fear of the effect
upon Belleville. If I had not heard him say so, I
could not have believed it.</p>

<p>As Washburne insisted, and Favre was in favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of the permission being given, an interview was arranged
with Trochu. The "Governor of Paris," as
he loved to call himself, made us another oration.
It was very much a rehash of the first. He then
stated that he had been unwilling that the "strangers"
should leave Paris; it looked like "rats deserting
the sinking ship;" he feared the effect upon
Belleville. But out of regard for Mr. Washburne,
and in deference to the opinion of some of his colleagues,
he would now consent. He added that he
would send an aid-de-camp to Belleville, to spread
the report that it was the diplomatic corps leaving
the capital. I looked at him with astonishment.
That he should tell a lie was bad enough, but that
he should tell it out of fear of that wretched mob
was a degree of weakness I was not prepared for.</p>

<p>Permission having been given, no time was lost in
the preparations for departure. On the 24th of October,
forty-eight Americans and several Russians
went out by Créteil. A number of English started,
but were turned back. Their names had not been
sent to Versailles in season. Permission was subsequently
received, and they left Paris a few days
later. We drove to the French outposts, and thence
sent forward the flag with an officer of Trochu's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
staff, and Mr. Washburne's private secretary, Mr.
Albert Ward, who was charged with the necessary
arrangements on our side. While we waited, a German
picket of six men advanced toward us, dodging
behind the trees, muskets cocked, and fingers on
trigger. I confess I was not much impressed with
this specimen of German scouting. It looked too
much like playing at North American Indian.
There were some twenty traveling-carriages, open
and closed, filled with ladies, and piled up with baggage.
The party had as little of a military look as
can well be imagined, and yet the picket advanced
as if they feared an ambush.</p>

<p>The necessary arrangements having been made,
we proceeded to the German outposts. Here the
Prussian officers verified the list, calling the roll
name by name, and taking every precaution to identify
the individuals. I heard afterward, however,
that a Frenchman of some prominence had escaped
disguised as a coachman.</p>

<p>I met here a young American, who was living not
far from Versailles, and who was known to Count
Bismarck. I gave him a couple of morning papers.
That evening he dined with Bismarck, and offered
to sell him the papers for a quart bottle of Cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>pagne
for the big one, and a pint bottle for the little
one. Bismarck offered a quart bottle for both;
but my American indignantly rejected the terms:
so Bismarck accepted his, and paid the bottle and a
half. I record this as perhaps the only diplomatic
triumph ever scored against Count de Bismarck.</p>

<p>Late in October, M. Thiers came into Paris on a
peace mission, but met with no success. He brought
the news of the fall of Metz. There was great excitement
in Paris. The mob collected, marched to
the Hôtel de Ville, and took possession. They arrested
several members of the Government, and shut
them up&mdash;others escaped. They then proceeded to
depose the Government, and to set up one of their
own. Ducrot begged Trochu to let him fire on the
mob; he could disperse them, he said, in five minutes.
The Mobiles were eager to fire; for the Mobiles
and the National Guard lived like cat and dog
together. Trochu would not consent. The insurgents
remained in possession of the Hôtel de Ville
all that night, and the next day gradually melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
away. It was one of those unfortunate mob triumphs
which contributed not a little to the success
of the Commune.</p>

<p>The siege found about two hundred Americans
in Paris. I ought to say "citizens of the United
States;" but we have taken to ourselves the broader
title, and in Europe it is generally accorded to us.
Of these two hundred about fifty went away, and
about one hundred and fifty remained. The French
live from hand to mouth, buying only what is necessary
for the day, and laying no stores in. This
comes, I think, from their system of living in apartments,
and the want of store-rooms. The Americans,
as a rule, laid in a stock of provisions. The grocers
of Paris had imported a large quantity of canned
food for the use of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">colonie américaine</i>, which was
then, and still is, a power in Paris. The greater part
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">colonie</i> having gone, there remained a quantity
of canned vegetables, fruit, deviled ham and turkey,
oysters, lobsters, etc., etc., and, above all, hominy and
grits. The French knew nothing of these eatables
till late in the siege, when they discovered their merits.
In the mean time the Americans had bought
up nearly all there was on hand.</p>

<p>As Thanksgiving approached we determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
celebrate it, notwithstanding our supposed forlorn
condition. Some thirty of us met at a restaurant on
the Boulevard, where we feasted on the traditional
turkey, or, rather, on two of them, at twelve dollars
apiece. Under the circumstances, we had quite an
Epicurean repast. Mr. Washburne presided, and
made a humorous speech, dwelling provokingly on
the good things our unbesieged countrymen were
then enjoying at home. Professor Shepherd, of
Chicago, was present, and made some clever and appropriate
remarks. The Professor has written one
of the most readable and reliable books upon the
siege I have met with.</p>

<p>Prices of food in Paris had now reached their
height. Turkeys, as I have said, sold at $12 apiece,
chickens at $6, cats $1.60, rats 15 cents, dogs from
80 cents up, according to size and fat. There was a
refinement in rats. They were known as the brewery
rat and the sewer rat. The brewery rat was
naturally the most delicate titbit, and as the siege
progressed and but little food found its way into the
sewers, the sewer rats diminished wofully in numbers,
while their brethren of the brewery increased.
I know of no better evidence of the severity of the
cold, and the scarcity of food during that winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
than an incident that came under my own observation.
I was called by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i> of the building
to look at the apartment of an American gentleman,
on the floor below me. The rats had made their
way with great gymnastic agility into the kitchen;
they had thrown down and broken two or three
dishes which the cook had imperfectly washed, and
on which there remained a little grease. They had
then made their way into the salons and bedrooms,
had gnawed and burrowed into the sofas and mattresses,
and there several lay, dead of cold and
hunger.</p>

<p>But there was no time in Paris when money
would not buy good food, though it could not buy
fuel, for that had been seized by the Government.
Very late in the siege a man brought to the Legation
a piece of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filet de bœuf</i> of six pounds, for which
he asked four dollars a pound. Mr. Washburne and
I did not indulge in such luxuries, living principally
upon our national pork and beans, and the poetic
fish-ball. A young American happened to be in the
office, however, who took it at once, and paid his
twenty-four dollars.</p>

<p>In the suburbs of Paris food was more abundant.
I breakfasted in December with a French general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
who commanded one of the outposts. We had beef,
eggs, ham, etc., and, from what I heard, I should say
that he and his staff breakfasted as well every day.
These noonday breakfasts, by-the-way, ruined the
French army. I reached my general's head-quarters
at half-past eleven. He and one of his staff were
smoking cigars and drinking absinthe. At twelve
we breakfasted bountifully, as I have said, and with
Champagne and other wines, followed by coffee,
brandy, and more cigars. We got through breakfast
about three o'clock. This was on an outpost,
in presence of the enemy. Had he attacked, what
would the general and his staff have been worth?
They were very far from being intoxicated, but certainly
their heads were not clear, or their judgments
sound.</p>

<p>The Prussians soon learned the French habits, and
attacked them in the field when they were making
their soup. The French soldiers could not catch up
their soup and pocket it, and eat it at their leisure.
They consequently lost not only their breakfasts,
but frequently their cooking utensils too. The Germans,
on the other hand, had a liberal ration of meat
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fleisch</i>&mdash;what a disagreeable word!)&mdash;one pound
and a half per diem. But, meat failing, they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
had a German sausage and a piece of bread in their
haversacks, and could eat as they marched. Yet
such is the power of habit in France, and the
strength of tradition, that I suppose the French soldier
will continue to all time to prepare his soup,
even at the expense of defeat.</p>

<p>Without stirring from Paris, I had the opportunity
during the siege to taste as many varieties of
wild meat as the greatest of travelers&mdash;as Humboldt
himself. It was found to be impossible to procure
food for the animals at the Jardin d'Acclimatation,
and they were sold and killed. They were bought
mostly by the enterprising English butcher of the
Avenue Friedland. I indulged from time to time
in small portions of elephant, yak, camel, reindeer,
porcupine, etc., at an average rate of four dollars
a pound. Of all these, reindeer is the best; it
has a fine flavor of venison. Elephant is tolerably
good. Some of my readers may remember the
charming twin elephants, Castor and Pollux, who
carried children round the Garden on their backs,
in 1867 to 1869. They were done to death with
chassepots&mdash;shot through the head. I eat a slice of
Castor. It was tolerably good only; did very well
in time of siege. But all these meats are but poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
substitutes for beef and mutton; and when travelers
tell us of the delights of elephant's trunk or buffalo's
hump, depend upon it, it is the hunter's appetite
that gives the flavor.</p>

<p>The main-stay of the population, in the way of
fresh meat, was horse. These were requisitioned,
and every horseholder having more than one was
compelled to contribute toward feeding the population.
The horses were liberally paid for, so much
per pound. Some individuals made a very good
thing out of it. They got in with the horse officials.
A fine animal, requisitioned from the owner, who
knew no better than to send it, appeared at the
shambles. One of these gentry, with the connivance
of the official in charge, would take him, and
substitute an old screw of equal or greater weight.
I know an American in Paris who is daily aggravated
by seeing at the Bois a beautiful mare he once
owned, and whose loss he had deeply deplored, but
had been comforted by the reflection that she had
perished to feed the starving Parisians.</p>

<p>The horse-meat was rationed and sold by the
Government at reasonable prices: nine ounces and
a half were allowed per diem to each adult. There
is a refinement in horse-meat, as in rats. A young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
light-gray is tender and juicy. Black is the worst
color; the meat is coarse and tough. But horse-flesh
is poor stuff at best. It has a sweet, sickening
flavor. Some people spoke highly of it as soup;
others when <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariné</i>. The only way I found it eatable
was as mince mixed with potato.</p>

<p>From horse-meat to beef is but a slight transition,
but one more easily made on paper than on the table
in those days. The interference of the French
Government in almost every detail of private life
is something of which happily we know nothing in
this country. You can not cut down a tree on your
own land without its permission. During the siege
you could not kill your own ox without leave from
the Minister of Commerce. If you had providently
laid in a larger supply of fuel than he thought you
needed, he took possession of it, and paid you Government
prices for what was then almost priceless.
An American lady resident in Paris had a cow.
The cow ran dry, and she wanted to convert it into
beef. She came to the Legation to secure Mr.
Washburne's intervention to obtain for her permission
to kill her own cow. At first it was refused,
and it required no inconsiderable amount of diplomatic
correspondence and the waste of many pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of good foolscap, with a large expenditure of red
tape and sealing-wax, before the permission was obtained.</p>

<p>I have said very little of the sorties from Paris.
The subject is not a pleasant one. There were five
hundred thousand armed men in Paris, and only
three hundred and fifty thousand outside. Yet but
one serious sortie was ever made. This was to the
south-east, under Ducrot; and the fighting was obstinate,
and lasted two days. Ducrot had published
a proclamation to the effect that he should come
back victorious, or be brought back dead. He was
defeated, but marched quietly back nevertheless.
We are unaccustomed among Anglo-Saxons to this
style of proclamation, and call it bombast. I am
told, however, by those better acquainted with the
French character than I am, that it has its effect
upon the French soldier, and is therefore allowable.</p>

<p>The garrison of Paris should have made a sortie
every night, sometimes a thousand men, and sometimes
a hundred thousand, and in two or three quarters
at once. Their central position gave them every
opportunity to do this to advantage. Had they
done so, they would soon have worn out the Germans
with constant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alertes</i>, and with comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>ly
little fatigue to themselves. But this, too, was
mismanaged. They surprised and took Le Bourget,
a little village to the north-east. Of course we all
supposed that it would be strongly garrisoned, and
the garrison well supported. Not at all. Two days
later the Prussians retook it. The garrison made a
most gallant defense, but they were entirely unsupported.
Not a regiment of the immense army in
Paris came to their assistance. No possible excuse
can be given for this abandonment.</p>

<p>The loss of Le Bourget produced great discontent
among the Parisians; and Trochu was blamed, and
most justly. He made an effort to retake it, but in
vain. The sailors, under their gallant officers, made
a spirited assault, but were repulsed with great loss;
for they were not supported by the soldiers. The
officers made every effort to lead them on, but they
would not assault.</p>

<p>The French naval officers are a very superior class
of men. They compare most favorably with those
of any other nation. They are painstaking, intelligent,
and well-informed. Under their command the
sailors fought gallantly during the war, for there
was a large number of them detailed to the army,
as they had little to do at sea. They felt strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the deterioration of their sister service, the army.
At Versailles I was once dining at a restaurant near
a naval officer. An army officer, accompanied by
two non-commissioned officers, entered, called loudly
for dinner, and made a great disturbance. They
were evidently the worse for liquor. I overheard
the naval officer muttering to himself, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cette pauvre
armée française! cette pauvre armée française!</i>"</p>

<p>There was always blundering. They had shut up
a brigade of cavalry in Paris. Jerome Bonaparte,
who commanded one of the regiments, told me he
had no idea why he was ordered in, unless it was to
eat up his horses. This they proceeded to do so soon
as they were fairly trained, and so doubled in value.
Trochu organized a sortie to the north-west. Two
columns left Paris one night by different gates, and
were to take up their positions simultaneously and
attack at daylight. He forgot that one road crossed
the other, and that one column must necessarily halt
for the other to pass. Of course one of them arrived
late on the ground, and the attack failed.
When a sortie was to be made, a flag was hoisted on
Mount Valérien. The Germans soon knew its meaning
as well as the French, and prepared accordingly.
An intended sortie was known at least twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
hours before it took place, and its chances discussed
on the boulevards. The National Guard, too, with
some honorable exceptions, would not fight. The
heroes of Belleville howled to be led against the enemy.
They got as far as the barriers, and refused
to go farther. "They were enlisted to defend Paris,
and they would not go beyond the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enceinte</i>; the
Reactionists wanted to get them out, that they might
deliver Paris over to the enemy." There was a popular
song they sung as they marched through the
streets which perfectly illustrates their sentiments
and character:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"Nous partons,</p>
<p class="verse8">ons, ons,</p>
<p class="verse">Comme des moutons,</p>
<p class="verse">Comme des moutons,</p>
<p class="verse">Pour la boucherie,</p>
<p class="verse8">rie, rie.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"On nous massacra,</p>
<p class="verse8">ra, ra,</p>
<p class="verse">Comme des rats,</p>
<p class="verse">Comme des rats.</p>
<p class="verse">Comme Bismarck rira!</p>
<p class="verse8">rira!"</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>An officer commanding a fort applied for re-enforcements
to relieve his exhausted men. They
sent him a battalion of our Belleville gentlemen.
The next day he sent them back, saying they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
been drunk and fought in the trenches all night, and
that he preferred to get along as well as he could
with his overworked garrison.</p>

<p>Trochu planned a sortie to the south-east. It was
necessary to cross the Marne. The troops arrived
at the appointed hour, but the pontoons did not. A
whole day was lost, and the sortie was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une affaire
manquée</i>. Outside, things were nearly as badly managed.
No serious effort was ever made to cut the
German lines of communication. The railways to
the east were all-important to them, not so much for
provisions (for they drew these mostly from France),
but for ammunition. With the enormous guns in
use, the transportation of ammunition was a serious
matter, taxing the railroad facilities of the Germans
to the uttermost. An interruption might have compelled
them to raise the siege. Sheridan, who, being
at the King's head-quarters, and treated with the
greatest kindness and attention, naturally sympathized
with the Germans, could not help exclaiming
that if he had been outside with thirty thousand cavalry,
he would have made the King *** Well, it
is not worth while to quote Sheridan's exact words;
they were a little in the style, of the commander of
the Imperial Guard at Waterloo; but the substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of them was, that an active officer with a good cavalry
force could have so broken up the communications
of the German army as to compel it to
raise the siege. For the Germans are not particularly
handy at repairing a broken road or bridge; and a
German general does not, as the rebel soldier said of
Sherman, carry a duplicate tunnel in his pocket.</p>

<p>As I am quoting Sheridan, let me here record his
opinion of the German army. He <em>believed</em> that they
were brave soldiers. They were well disciplined,
well led, and had every appearance of thorough soldiers;
but he could not say so positively, for, so far
as his observation went, they had never met with
any serious resistance. He looked upon the German
army as in no respect superior to one of our great
armies at the close of the war&mdash;the Army of the
Potomac, for instance&mdash;except as regards the staff.
That was far superior to ours, and to any staff in Europe.
Their field telegraph, too, excited his admiration.
It had been borrowed from us, but improved.</p>

<p>A gentleman of rank and great historic name, of
approved bravery, and who had seen service as an
officer in the French army, came one day to the
Legation in the uniform of a private. I asked him
why he had enlisted, when he could so easily have
got a commission. He replied that it was true he
could easily have got a company in the National
Guard, but before he could know his men, and they
could know him, and he could drill and discipline
them, they would go into action. Then they would
inevitably run away. If he ran with them, he would
be held responsible; if he stood, he would be killed.
So he had decided to enlist as a private, to stand as
long as the rest stood, and to run away when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ran. It struck me that this gentleman was wise in
his generation, but that it was not precisely in this
way that France was to be saved.</p>

<p>In speaking of the National Guard as I have done,
it is proper to state that I speak of the masses, the
workmen of Paris, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite bourgeoisie</i> of most
of the arrondissements. There were some few battalions
that could be relied upon, some composed in
part of the "gentlemen of France;" but they were
insufficient to leaven the whole lump. The masses,
those who drew a franc and a half per diem for
themselves, and seventy-five centimes for their wives,
or for the women who lived with them&mdash;for the Government
of the National Defense had decided that
it was the same thing&mdash;were the turbulent, unruly,
unsoldierly mob I have described.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and satisfactory features
of the siege was the American ambulance.
Here were order, system, and discipline. It was located
on vacant lots in the Avenue de l'Impératrice.
It did better work than any other ambulance in
Paris; and there were many of them. A number of
the wealthy people of the city gave up their hotels,
or parts of them, for this purpose. The Press organized
an admirable ambulance, copied as much from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the American as circumstances would permit. The
Italians started one, and two or three other nationalities.
But the American ambulance was the only
one organized upon the tent system, which is unquestionably
the true one. Fresh air and fresh water
are what is needed for the wounded. It is impossible
to get fresh air in a building, as you get it
in a tent. As Dr. Swinburne expressed it, "The air
filters through the canvas."</p>

<p>At the Exposition of 1867 we had a remarkably
good exhibition of our ambulance system. It was
due to the energy and liberality of Dr. Evans. At
the close of the exhibition he bought the whole collection;
and when the war broke out, he organized
an ambulance association, presented it with this material,
and gave it ten thousand francs. Other Americans
contributed, and the enterprise was launched.
Dr. Swinburne, a distinguished corps surgeon of our
army, and afterward Quarantine Officer at Staten
Island, happened to be in Paris, traveling for his
health and amusement. He gave up his trip, and
staid in the city, that he might be of service to the
wounded French. He deserves much credit for his
humanity. Dr. Johnson, a prominent American physician
in Paris, took charge of the medical depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>ment.
Both of these gentlemen discharged their
duties with devotion and skill, and with remarkable
success, and without remuneration, except that they
were decorated by the French Government. For an
American residing at home a decoration is of very
little account. In France it is useful. It procures
him attention on the railways and at the restaurants.
But it has been very much abused of late years.
There are about one hundred thousand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décorés</i> in
France, so that they now say it is the correct thing
not to be decorated. I never heard of but one individual,
however, who refused it, and that was from
political motives.</p>

<p>A number of American ladies and gentlemen who
remained in Paris offered their services in the ambulance,
and were enrolled as volunteer nurses. Among
them Mr. Joseph K. Riggs was particularly conspicuous
by his skill and devotion. They went upon the
field after, or even during, an engagement and picked
up the wounded. Indeed, there was quite a contest
among the ambulances to get possession of the
wounded; for while the number of the sick in Paris
was very great, that of the wounded was comparatively
small. The medical director of General Ducrot's
corps became much interested in our ambu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>lance.
He turned over to Dr. Swinburne the charming
house of M. Chevalier, the eminent French
writer on political economy, and then begged him
to take charge of the wounded of his corps. Swinburne
used the house as a convalescent hospital when
his tents were full.</p>

<p>So successful was his treatment that of the amputated
only one in five died; while at the great French
ambulance of the Grand Hôtel four in five died.
The mortality there was fearful.</p>

<p>The apparatus for warming the tents was simple,
but most effective. It had grown up among our
soldiers during the war. A hole was made in the
ground outside of one end of a long tent, a stove
placed in it, and the pipe carried the whole length
of the tent in a trench. The result was that the
ground was thoroughly dried and warmed, and this
warmed the whole tent. I have known the thermometer
outside to be at 20° Fahrenheit, while in
the tents it stood at 55°. The doctor said that for
wounded men well covered up in bed 55° was better
than 70°.</p>

<p>The men were well fed, and admirably cared for
generally. The French Government put the best
of their stores at the disposition of the ambulances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and treated them with the greatest liberality. There
was always plenty of canned fruit, jellies, etc., in
Paris, so valuable in sickness. The ladies bought
these, and brought them to the wounded. Tobacco
was provided in the same way for the convalescents.</p>

<p>The American ambulance was soon so well and so
favorably known, that I heard of French officers who
put cards in their pocket-books, on which they had
written the request that if they were wounded they
might be carried to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'ambulance américaine</i>.</p>

<p>The great drawback we had to contend with
was the impossibility of procuring new tents. Dr.
Swinburne told me that at home they would have
been condemned after a month's use, and new ones
substituted. But in Europe the cloth is not to be
had. We use cotton cloth, the French use linen.
Cotton is lighter, is more porous in dry and fulls in
wet weather. The result is that the air filters
through it in the one case, and the water does not
penetrate it in the other. In the absence of new
canvas, the doctor thoroughly fumigated the old
from time to time. This answered the purpose tolerably
well, but did not exhibit the tent system in
its perfection.</p>

<p>We had now reached the middle of January, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the end of the siege was rapidly approaching. The
want of proper food, especially for young children,
was producing its necessary results; and the death-rate
had risen from about eight hundred&mdash;which is
the average number of weekly deaths in Paris&mdash;to
four thousand, and this without counting those in hospital
which may be set down at one thousand more.
The number of poor Germans supported by the Legation
had also increased very greatly, and had risen to
twenty-four hundred. We were compelled to hire
another room, where the weekly allowance made
them was paid and duly entered in books kept for
this purpose; for every penny expended was regularly
entered and vouched for. The poor German
women were obliged to walk two or three miles on
those cold winter days; for the workmen's quarter is
far from that of the Champs Elysées. Mr. Washburne
pitied these poor creatures, and gave them omnibus
tickets for the return trip. He bought a cask
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin ordinaire</i>, too, and gave a glass of warm
sweetened wine to each of them. It did them infinite
good.</p>

<p>Provisions were now running short; enough remained
for a few days only. Even in this most
vital matter there was blundering. A gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
high placed in the office of the Minister of Commerce,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ministère</i> which had charge of the supplies,
told Mr. Washburne that there were provisions
in Paris to last till March. We could hardly credit
it, but it came to us from such high authority that
we were staggered. He spoke positively, and said
he had seen the figures. After the surrender this
gentleman met a mutual friend, and said, "I am
afraid your minister must take me for either a liar
or a fool. I hope I am neither. The mistake we
made at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ministère</i> happened in this way: the
minister appointed two officers; each was to take an
account of all the food in Paris, in order that one
account might control the other. When their statements
came in, he added them together, but forgot
to divide them by two."</p>

<p>Meantime we were being bombarded, but after a
very mild fashion. I have since talked with a German
general who commanded at the quarter whence
most of the shells entered the city. He assured me
that there never was the slightest intention to bombard
Paris. If there had been, it would have been
done in a very different style. The German batteries
fired from a height upon a fort in the hollow,
and their shells, flying high, entered Paris. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
when nearly two hundred lives were lost, and shells
fell among us for nineteen days, people had a right to
say that they were bombarded, and no Parisian will
admit to this day that they were not. Artillery-men
of all nations become not only very careless, but
very wanton. The Germans were eager to hit something,
and the public buildings of the Latin Quarter
offered a tempting mark to the gunners. I was complaining
to a French officer one day of the shameful
manner in which the French Government troops during
the Commune bombarded the quarter of the
Champs Elysées, a quarter inhabited almost exclusively
by friends of the Government, who were longing
for the troops to come in. He told me that it
was due to the wantonness of the artillery-men, and
cited an instance which came under his own observation.
A gunner at Mount Valérien pointed out to
the captain of the gun a cart making its slow way
through the distant plain toward Paris, and exclaimed,
"O, my officer! see that cart carrying supplies
to the enemy." "Where, where?" "There, near
that white house." "Give it a shell." He fired,
missed half a dozen times, but finally hit. It turned
out to be the cart of a poor washer-woman, carrying
the week's wash to her customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days before the surrender bad news came
thick and fast. A sortie in the direction of Mount
Valérien had been repulsed. Chanzy had been defeated.
All hope of aid from that quarter had vanished,
and but a few days' provisions remained.
Will it be believed that even then Trochu "paltered
in a double sense" with the suffering people? He
published a proclamation in which he said the "Governor
of Paris would never surrender." The next
day he resigned, and appointed no successor. When,
three days later, the city surrendered there was no
Governor of Paris.</p>

<p>But even to the last moment there were people
who had confidence in Trochu's proclamation. The
Parisians are credulous, and readily believe what
they wish to believe. Among the populace there
was always a sort of half belief in the "Plan Trochu,"
which, as he often told us, when all else failed,
was to save France. This plan he kept mysteriously
to himself, or confided it only to a few bosom-friends.
But I had it from a source I thought entitled to belief,
that Trochu confidently anticipated a miracle in
his favor in return for his devotion. St. Genevieve
was to appear and save Paris. It is almost impossible
to believe that, in the nineteenth century, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that skeptical capital, a man of intelligence, cultivation,
and varied experience, could be found who believed
in a miraculous appearance of the saint; but
Trochu was a strange compound of learning, ability,
weakness, and fanaticism, and I have little doubt
that he confidently anticipated the personal intervention
of St. Genevieve to save her beloved city.</p>

<p>On the 24th of January, Vinoy took command.
He suppressed the clubs, seized the violent press,
and took other energetic measures. A mob attacked
Mazas, and released the prisoners. They then tried
the Hôtel de Ville a second time; but they had now
a different commander to deal with, and they were
beaten off with ease. Mr. Washburne and I happened
to be in the neighborhood of the Hôtel de
Ville, and saw something of this affair. We did not
stay to the end, however, for we felt that it was
not the proper place for us, accredited as we were
to the Government the mob was attempting to overthrow.
Had Vinoy or Ducrot been in command
from the beginning, the result might have been
different. There was no reason why the National
Guard should not have made good soldiers; but they
needed a discipline of iron. They were permitted
to choose their own officers. This of itself was fatal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
In the beginning of our war in some of the States
the company officers were elected by the men. But
the men themselves were the first to see the folly of
this course, and petitioned that their officers might
be appointed by the Executive. Had the officers of
the National Guard been appointed by the Government,
and when they halted at the barrier and refused
to go farther, had a battery been ordered up,
and a dozen or so of them shot, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour encourager les
autres</i>," as the French said of Admiral Byng, they
might have given a very different account of themselves
in their combats with the Germans.</p>

<p>On the 27th of January, with seven days' provisions
only in Paris, with every man, woman, and
child on the shortest possible allowance, the city surrendered.
An armistice was agreed upon, which
was not, however, to apply to the armies of the East
operating toward Lyons. It is said that the French
commander in that quarter was not notified that the
armistice did not extend to him. He was attacked,
caught napping, and defeated.</p>

<p>If I recollect correctly, it was Bourbaki who was
defeated in the East. Bourbaki is the type of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau militaire</i> of the French Empire. A dashing,
gallant soldier, he had distinguished himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
gained his promotion by scaling the walls of an
Arab town at the head of his troops, armed with a
light riding-whip only. But these were not the
men then wanted at the head of the French armies.
When Bourbaki was defeated, and his army
in retreat, making its disorderly way to Switzerland,
and needing all its General's care and attention, he
attempted to commit suicide. In the German service
he would undoubtedly have been tried for desertion.
In France every thing is pardoned to a man
who acts under the influence of strong emotion; and
Bourbaki was never even blamed for leaving his
army to its fate.</p>

<p>During the armistice an election took place. The
Assembly met at Bordeaux late in February, and
steps were taken toward peace. All sorts of rumors
were current as to the terms, and it was said that
they were so severe that France must fight on at all
hazards rather than accept them. Ten <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'mlliards'">milliards</ins>, it
was rumored, were to be paid (two thousand millions
of dollars). Alsace and Lorraine and a French colony
were to be given up, and a number of French
men-of-war made over to Germany. The preliminaries
were finally agreed upon: five milliards were to
be paid, and Alsace and Lorraine transferred. German
troops were to occupy Mount Valérien and to
enter Paris, and hold a part of it until peace was
definitively signed. The Crown Prince was reported
to have been opposed to the troops entering the cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>ital,
as humiliating to the French, and not a military
necessity; but he was overruled.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March I was awakened by military
music. I had not heard any for a long time, the
French bands having been broken up. I hurried
out, and found that the Germans were entering
Paris. First came the traditional Uhlans. The safety
with which these troops rode in pairs through a
great part of France was a curious feature of the
war. They were followed by their supports. Then
came a mixed band of about one thousand troops,
representing all arms and the different German nationalities.
They were sent as an advance-guard to
secure and prepare the quarters assigned the troops
by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maires</i>. In the mean time, the Emperor was
holding a review at Longchamps, on the very field
where, three years and a half before, he had assisted
at the review of sixty thousand French troops by the
Emperor Napoleon, and it was not until the afternoon
that the main body, the Prussian Guard, the
Saxons, and the Bavarians, marched into the city.
They occupied the quarter of the Champs Elysées,
extending as far as the Place de la Concorde&mdash;in
all about one-eighth of Paris.</p>

<p>This was a busy day for me. Mr. Washburne was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
overrun with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierges</i> and servants complaining
that the Prussians were occupying American apartments.
I went to the mayor of the arrondissement.
He said that he had quartered the Germans impartially
upon all the householders; that the French
law exempted apartments of an annual value of less
than one hundred dollars; that in his arrondissement,
as I knew, the apartments were either remarkably
good or remarkably poor; that the good ones
were occupied principally by foreigners, and that the
poor ones were exempt. From the mayor I went
to the German commander occupying the house of
Queen Christine on the Champs Elysées, and was
told at his head-quarters that they had nothing to
say in the matter; that they had requisitioned a certain
number of rooms from the French authorities,
and that they must go where those authorities sent
them, and had no right to go elsewhere; that it was
then too late to make any change that day, but that
if Mr. Washburne would find them quarters elsewhere,
they would cheerfully vacate all American
apartments the next day. In the mean time Washburne
had been to Jules Favre. Favre told him
that there was every prospect that the terms of peace
would be accepted by the Assembly at Bordeaux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that evening, and that the Germans, in accordance
with the treaty, would leave Paris the next day.
They were accepted that evening; but Bismarck
wished to give as many German troops as possible
an opportunity to enter Paris, and so refused to accept
the telegraphic announcement of the acceptance
of the treaty by the Assembly. The next day the
written official notice arrived, and the day after Paris
was evacuated. The Germans remained in Paris
three days. They did no harm. I heard of nothing
missing but a few blankets. By the terms of the
treaty thirty thousand were to occupy Paris. It was
rumored that the garrison was changed every night,
and that ninety thousand entered in all.</p>

<p>The attitude of the people of Paris toward the
conquerors was, upon the whole, excellent. They
staid away from the occupied quarter, and minded
their own business. In this quarter the shops were
all closed, except a few restaurants and cafés that the
Germans insisted should be opened. Some of these
cafés were afterward gutted by the mob, which was
rather hard on the owners, as they had been compelled
to open them. But a mob is never just. Some
few of the populace fraternized with the invaders,
and were to be seen talking amicably with them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and some of the rougher element attempted to create
a disturbance, but were soon overawed by the
great numbers and martial bearing of the conquerors.
While only thirty thousand were in Paris, there can
be little doubt that a hundred thousand were within
a half-hour's march, ready to enter to the assistance
of their comrades if needed. Indeed, I imagine that
all the troops who passed in review before the Emperor
at Longchamps either occupied Paris, or were
bivouacked in the Bois during the three days of the
occupation.</p>

<p>They had come in very quietly, and with military
precautions against surprise. They went out with a
flourish of trumpets. They had bivouacked in large
numbers about the Arch, and their camp-fires lighted
up the inscriptions on that magnificent monument
recording the victories of French over German arms.
It certainly is most creditable to the conquerors that
they did the Arch no harm. Few nations would
have been so magnanimous. The weather was perfect,
the night mild and balmy, the moon nearly full,
and the beautiful German camp-songs, admirably
sung, resounded in the stillness of the hour till ten
o'clock struck, when perfect silence reigned in the
camp. When the Germans entered Paris, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
marched round the Arch; when they went out they
took down the chains which inclose it, and every
regiment of infantry and cavalry, and every battery
of artillery passed directly under it, drums beating,
colors flying, and the men cheering as they passed.
They were gloriously repaid for the trials of the
campaign.</p>

<p>Ten days passed after the surrender, and apparently
the French authorities had made no provision to
revictual Paris. There was no beef, to speak of, in
the city, and very little mutton. The bread remained
the same wretched dark stuff, one-third flour, two-thirds
pease, beans, oats, rice, straw&mdash;in fact, any refuse.
Delicious white bread, fresh butter, and eggs
were to be bought of the German soldiers just beyond
the barriers; and any one who took the trouble,
and had the means, could procure these luxuries at
reasonable prices. The peasants sold them to the
German soldiers, and they were permitted to resell
them at a small profit. The first train of provisions
to enter Paris was sent by the citizens of London, to
their credit be it spoken. Will it be believed that
considerable difficulty was experienced in finding persons
willing to take the trouble to distribute this
food gratuitously? It was done to a very limited ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>tent
at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mairies</i>. The great dry-goods establishment
of the Bon Marché distributed a portion; but
much was stored in the Halles de l'Abondance for
want of distribution, and burned up when that establishment
was destroyed during the Commune. I remember
hearing a Chauvin of the Assembly at Versailles
pitch into the English for coming over after
the Commune to visit Paris in her desolation. He
was answered by Jules Favre, as happily as truly,
that "the English, before they organized their
trains of pleasure, had organized their trains of relief."</p>

<p>In this connection let me state that more than two
millions of dollars were sent from the United States.
At least two cargoes of provisions arrived at Havre,
our Government supplying the vessels. No one
could be found to distribute the supplies. The
French are so government-ridden that they are unable
to take the initiative in any thing for themselves.
I have seen a strong, bold man, a guide in
the Pyrenees, stand wringing his hands and crying,
while his house was on fire, waiting for the soldiers
to come and save his furniture and put out the
flames. One of the shiploads of provisions I speak
of was sent to London, sold there, and the proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
distributed to the poor of France. Part of the relief
sent was distributed through the Government, but
experience showed this method to be slow&mdash;there was
too much red-tape about it. The funds were finally
placed in the hands of American ladies and gentlemen
residing at Paris and Versailles, whose knowledge
of France and acquaintance with French people
gave them the means of making a judicious distribution.
A part was expended by a committee of ladies,
of which Madame MacMahon was the President;
something was placed at the disposal of the Countess
of Paris, out of regard for her husband, who had
served in our army during the war; and a very large
portion was distributed through the Sisters of Charity.
Nothing could be more judicious, and at the
same time more thoroughly business-like, than the
manner in which these admirable women disposed
of the money intrusted to them, rendering a voucher
for every franc they expended. One felt that every
penny in their hands had been placed where it was
most needed, and would do most good.</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne left Paris early in February for
Brussels, where his family were residing, and where,
by-the-way, a very large number of our Parisian
Americans had taken refuge. But he came back in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
a week, feeling quite poorly. He had been so overrun
with visitors making inquiries or asking favors,
that he had had no rest, and so returned to the lately
beleaguered city for a little quiet. I remained until
the Germans had made their triumphal entry, and
their more triumphal departure, and then got leave
and went to London to join my family.</p>

<p>But it has rarely been my lot, in the course of my
official life, to enjoy an uninterrupted leave of absence.
The present was no exception. I was scarcely
fairly installed in England, and fighting "my battles
o'er again," and showing "how fields were lost",
when there came a telegram from Mr. Washburne
telling me that there were disturbances in Paris, and
that I must return immediately. Some of the National
Guard of the Belleville and Montmartre quarters
had taken advantage of the confusion reigning
immediately after the surrender, and seized several
field-guns and mitrailleuses, and carried them off to
their fastnesses on Montmartre. They now refused
to surrender them; and when the Government at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>tempted
to take them, the troops fraternized with
the mob, and deserted their generals, Lecompte and
Thomas, whom the Communists forthwith shot. It
was said that Count Bismarck had urged the disarming
of the National Guard at the time of the surrender.
Trochu's Government had refused. They
must have bitterly regretted it afterward.</p>

<p>On my return I entered Paris by the Gare St.
Lazare. That usually peaceful temple of traffic was
thronged by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardes Nationaux</i>&mdash;"The National
Guard of Order," they called themselves, or were
called, to distinguish them from the Communists.
These gentlemen appeared to be enjoying themselves.
They were comfortably housed in the building,
and lounged and chatted there, not without frequent
visits to the neighboring cafés. I found that
they held the Grand Hotel, and the new Opera-house,
both strong positions, and within easy supporting
distance of each other. They also held the
Bourse, the Bank of France, the "Finances," and
many other "coignes of vantage." But "coignes of
vantage" are of very little use when the heart to defend
them is lacking. In a very few days these
men, outnumbering the Communists two or three to
one, backed by the power of the Government and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the wealth of Paris, and by the moral support of the
Germans and of the civilized world, had disbanded,
taken refuge in flight, and left their families, and
their property, and their beautiful city to the tender
mercies of the mob.</p>

<p>It was a matter of the utmost astonishment to me,
and to every one with whom I conversed, that the
National Guard of Order should have behaved as
they did. I never understood it till I talked with
my barber just after his battalion had disbanded, and
before he had escaped to London. They got tired
of sleeping away from their families, getting their
meals irregularly, and having to pay restaurant-prices
for them. They were in a state of disgust,
too, with the Government, who refused to pass an
act to relieve them from their rents accrued during
the siege. My barber was an excellent representative
of his class, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite bourgeoisie</i>; a well-to-do
man, employing two apprentices, making a good
livelihood, and laying by something for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dot</i> for his
children&mdash;economical, intelligent, sober. He belonged
to the most respectable battalion in the city, that
of the quarter of the "Finances." I expressed my
surprise at their disbanding. He said that the Government
would do nothing for them, so they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
do nothing for the Government: it might put down
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeute</i> itself. So they abandoned their property
and their homes and their idolized Paris, shut up
their shops, and ran away.</p>

<p>The relations between the Government and the
governed in France are difficult for an American to
understand. In the United States and in England
the Government is <em>our</em> government, its interests are
<em>our</em> interests, and we stand by and defend it, not
only because it is our duty to do so, but because it is
<em>ours</em>. This feeling does not exist in France among
the masses, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit commerce</i> and the peasantry.
They look upon the Government as a foreign body
which has somehow or other&mdash;it matters very little
how&mdash;got possession of power. As long as it preserves
order, prevents crime, insures prosperity, and
gratifies vanity by foreign conquests, it is firmly
seated; but the moment it ceases to be able to do
all this, let it go, and try another.</p>

<p>It is a strange notion of the duties of a Government
that it must insure prosperity; but it prevails
very generally among the masses in France, and is
not unknown among the uneducated classes in other
countries. The theory of the Long Island fisherman
is more generally acted upon than is acknowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>edged:
"He knew Governor Dix, and he liked
Governor Dix, but he hadn't averaged an eel to a
pot all summer; and he thought he would try a
new governor."</p>

<p>The conduct of the Government, or, rather, that
of M. Thiers&mdash;for at that time Thiers was the Government,
and he might have said with perfect truth,
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'état c'est moi</i>"&mdash;has been much and harshly criticised.
Whether this criticism is just or not, depends
upon the loyalty or disloyalty of the troops. If they
were true to their colors and ready to fight the mob,
as they afterward did, there never was a more cowardly
and disgraceful surrender than the retreat to
Versailles, as unwise and unmilitary as it was cowardly,
for it discouraged the respectable citizens, and
abandoned to the mob all the advantages of position,
immense war material, and the unbounded wealth
of the capital. It was proceeding upon Artemus
Ward's military plan. Artemus said that if he were
in a city with fifty thousand men, besieged by an
enemy with fifty thousand men, he would open the
gates and march out, and let them march in, and then
besiege them. Artemus and M. Thiers appear to
have studied in the same military school. But if, as
Thiers alleged, the army could not be relied upon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
but were ready to raise the butts of their muskets "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
air</i>" and fraternize with the Communists, then there
never was a wiser movement: it was truly a "masterly
retreat." Had what Thiers apprehended happened,
had the troops fraternized with the mob, a
movement which was only an insurrection&mdash;a bloody
one, it is true, but confined to one city&mdash;would have
spread over France, and there would have been a
repetition, with aggravation, of all the horrors of the
first Revolution.</p>

<p>Before the National Guard of Order disbanded,
several well-intentioned efforts were made by officers
of rank to effect an organization among the citizens
against the insurgents. Admiral de Saissy either
volunteered, or was sent by the Government, to take
command. He made his head-quarters at the Grand
Hôtel, within a stone's-throw of the Communists intrenched
in the Place Vendôme. Here they were
isolated, far from their supports at Belleville and
Montmartre. Why the Admiral did not place a battery
in position in the Tuileries Gardens, commanding
the Place Vendôme by the Rue Castiglione, or
why he did not simply starve the Communists out, I
never knew: probably he could not depend upon his
men. I am confirmed in this belief by a circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>stance
which happened within my own observation.
Two or three French gentlemen called at the Legation
one morning, to say that a young American
friend, a Mr. Delpit, of New Orleans, had been arrested
by the Communists, and was then a prisoner
in the Place Vendôme, and would probably be dragged
that day before a Communist court-martial, condemned,
and shot. Mr. Washburne was at Versailles.
I immediately sent his private secretary, an attaché
of the Legation, furnished with all the necessary
documents, to his relief. In a very short time Mr.
M'Kean returned, after a most successful mission.
He had seen Delpit, he had seen the insurgent authorities,
and they had promised to discharge their prisoner
that very day. They did so. The next day he
came up to thank us for our prompt intervention in
his behalf, which had undoubtedly saved his life. I
naturally asked him how he happened to be arrested.
He said that he had gone to see Admiral de Saissy,
whom he knew, at the Grand Hôtel; that the Admiral
was very anxious to send a dispatch to a distant
part of the city; that the Admiral's aid was ready
to start, but that there appeared to be a very unanimous
indisposition on the part of the officers of the
National Guard to accompany him; that thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
he volunteered. The Admiral jumped at the offer,
and said, "<em>You</em> will go, I know; <em>you</em> are an American;
<em>you</em> are not afraid." A French commander
must have been very much provoked by the conduct
of the officers about him to use such language in
their presence. Delpit and the aid started, but had
gone but a little way, when they were surrounded
by a squad of the insurgents, who ordered them to
halt. Delpit drew his revolver, and threatened to
shoot, while he told his companion to run. The aid
escaped. The insurgents leveled their pieces, and
were about to fire, when Delpit, seeing that his companion
had escaped, concluded that discretion was
the better part of valor, and surrendered. They disarmed
him, treating him very roughly, and one of
them&mdash;a negro&mdash;spat in his face. They shut him up
in a cellar in the Place Vendôme, and it was likely
to go hard with him, when M'Kean appeared upon
the scene. Delpit told me that when they found
that he was cared for by the Legation, their conduct
changed marvelously. They treated him with the
greatest respect, and the colored brother who had
spit in his face was particularly marked in his attentions.
Delpit has since distinguished himself as
a poet. His work on the siege of Paris was crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
by the Academy, and he is the author of a successful
play, which means much in France.</p>

<p>But Admiral de Saissy had had enough of it. He
gave it up, and went back to Versailles. The National
Guard of Order disbanded, and King Mob
reigned triumphant.</p>

<p>At first King Mob was a good-natured monarch.
He collected a lot of pitch-pine torches, and lighted
them on top of the Vendôme Column. The effect
was good. He made bonfires, fired off guns, organized
processions, made speeches; in fact, behaved like
any first-class American city on the Fourth of July.
This did not last long, however. The tiger soon
showed his claws. The party of order, having given
up their arms and disbanded, proceeded to organize
what they called a "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démonstration pacifique</i>," designed
to produce a moral effect upon a horde of
savages. They paraded the streets in large numbers
unarmed. The first day's procession was rather a
success. It was a novelty, and took. The second
day's was not so successful. They marched up the
Rue de la Paix, intending, in the grandeur of their
moral strength, to pass straight through the Place
Vendôme, the tiger's lair. The barricades were to
disappear at their approach, the insurgents were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
throw themselves into their arms, and there was to
be one huge kiss of peace and reconciliation. Unfortunately,
things did not turn out as set down in
the bills. The barriers did not melt away, and the
insurgents refused to kiss and make friends. On the
contrary, they opened fire on the procession, and
several of its numbers were killed. It was a well-meant
effort, but Quixotic to the last degree.</p>

<p>And now the tiger had tasted blood, and his appetite
grew by what it fed on. But his rage increased
by degrees, advancing from one atrocity to another,
till it culminated in the slaughter of the hostages.</p>

<p>There was a mixture of the ridiculous with the
infamous in the early acts of the Commune. Its
members were very numerous; so, for working purposes
they appointed a "Committee of Public Safety,"
which very soon belied its name. These men
appointed the ministers. To call a man "Minister
of War" was not democratic, so they called him "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">citoyen
délégué au Ministère de la Guerre</i>." The title
of "General" they found inconsistent with the simplicity
of republican institutions, and so suppressed
it. "Colonel" could pass muster, but "General"
was too aristocratic for their dainty ears. Then they
found that, like other mere mortals, they must live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and provide for their families. It was so much easier
to pillage a shop than to work! The shop-keeper
should be proud to contribute to the well-being of
the brave defenders of the Republic! Then they
published a decree seizing all the workshops, that
they might be occupied by Communist workmen on
the co-operative system. A jury was to be appointed&mdash;by
the Commune, of course&mdash;to assess the value
of the property, and compensation was to be made
to the owner. As a practical measure, this was not
a success. The workmen found it pleasanter to play
soldier, and to take what they wanted, than to work
even on the co-operative system. So the workshops
generally remained in the hands of their owners.
Next they commenced the work of demolition, and
almost equaled the great Haussmann in this respect.
They pulled down the house of M. Thiers (the Assembly
has since built him a better one); and they
passed decrees to tear down the houses of Jules Favre
and other members of the Government, and confiscate
their property. Happily the patriots to whom
the execution of these decrees was intrusted were
not perfectly immaculate; they could generally <em>be
seen</em>. In this way much less irreparable injury was
done than might have been expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>One of their follies was the destruction of the
Colonne Vendôme. An eminent artist&mdash;Courbet&mdash;who
was a member of the Commune, said that it
offended his artistic taste. Others of this band of
brothers said that it perpetuated the victory of war
over peace; that it kept alive a feeling of triumph
in the conquerors and revenge in the conquered;
that the peoples should be brothers, etc., etc. So
they pulled it down; and the present Government
forthwith rebuilt it, and the courts have condemned
M. Courbet to pay the expense.</p>

<p>When the Column was pulled down, all the shop-windows
within half a mile were pasted over with
strips of paper to prevent their being broken by
the shock. It fell, and people two hundred yards
off did not know that any thing unusual had happened.
It was a question much discussed how far
the prostrate Column would reach. Its length was
generally much overestimated. It was thought that
it would extend at least one hundred feet into the
Rue de la Paris. It did not enter the street, nor
even cross the Place Vendôme. The bronze plates
were nearly all saved. Some few were disposed of
by the Communist soldiers. One was sold by a
sailor to a lady for five hundred francs. He after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ward
denounced her to the Government, and got five
hundred francs more for doing so. A profitable
transaction! One was sold to an American, and
made the voyage to New York, where it was found
by the French Consul, reclaimed, and returned to
Paris.</p>

<p>As soon as the Government had moved to Versailles,
the diplomatic corps followed. Mr. Washburne
hired a large room in the Rue de Mademoiselle
(the sister of Louis XIV.&mdash;all Versailles bears the
impress of the reign of that monarch). This room
had to do for office, bedroom, and sitting-room; for
Versailles was crowded, and we were lucky to get
any thing so comfortable. As we had far more to
do at Paris than at Versailles, and Paris was then, as
always, the seat of attraction, Mr. Washburne spent
four days of the week in that city, and three at Versailles,
and I alternated with him. We had passes
from both sides. I made the trip twice a week, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sometimes under considerable difficulties. I have
traveled more than thirty miles to reach Paris from
Versailles, a distance of nine miles, partly in a diligence,
partly on foot, partly in flat-boats to cross
the Seine where the French had most unnecessarily
blown up their own beautiful bridges, and partly by
rail. I suppose that I am better acquainted with the
westerly environs of Paris than any foreigner but a
medical student. Some of the drives in the months
of April and May, especially one by Sceaux and
Fontaine-les-Roses, and up the valley of the Bièvre,
are very lovely.</p>

<p>But after a while we had a regular organized line
by St. Denis. The Germans occupied this town,
and insisted upon keeping open the railroad into
Paris, the Chemin de Fer du Nord. They said that
under the treaty they had a right to draw certain
supplies from France, and that Paris was the most
convenient place to draw them from, and from Paris
they meant to draw them; and that if the Communists
did not keep the Porte St. Denis open, <em>they</em>
would. The Commune always had a wholesome
fear of the Germans; this was all that restrained
them from even greater outrages than they perpetrated;
and they hated the Germans less than they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
their own countrymen at Versailles. In going to
Versailles we took the train to St. Denis; there we
hired a carriage, or took the public conveyance, and
so drove to our destination, a trip of about three
hours in all: or we drove out by the Porte St. Denis,
and so all the way to Versailles. This was generally
my route, for a number of American and
French friends asked me to bring their horses and
carriages from the ill-fated city. If the Communist
officers at the gates were close observers, they must
have thought that I was the owner of one of the
largest and best-appointed stables in Paris.</p>

<p>There was very little to do at Versailles, and perhaps
less to eat. The Government was there, and
the Assembly, and the Corps Diplomatique, and
consequently the crowd of people who had business
with these bodies, thronged to that city. At the
restaurants it was a struggle to get any thing; and
when you got it, it was not precisely in the Café
Anglais style. I found two or three pleasant American
families who had wintered here very quietly
during the German occupation. They had had no
occasion to complain of their treatment. At the
Hôtel de France I found Dr. Hosmer, the intelligent
and cultivated principal correspondent of the <cite>Herald</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
That enterprising journal had its staff of couriers,
who were always at our service during those
days of irregular postal communication. At the Hôtel
des Réservoirs several German princes, officers of
the army, were lodged&mdash;intelligent, agreeable, cultivated
gentlemen. They were only too glad to have
the pleasure of the society of American ladies, for
of course they could not visit the French; and no
class of men long for and appreciate ladies' society
like educated officers on campaign in an enemy's
country. They eagerly accepted invitations to dine
with my friends for a double reason, the pleasure
of their society, and that of a good dinner; for the
French cook never could manage, though of course
he did his best, to cook a good dinner for the Germans,
and the landlord was always just out of that
favorite brand of Champagne.</p>

<p>The day after my first arrival at Versailles I made
an excursion to the battle-field at Clamart, near
Meudon. The Communists had been defeated there
the day before. I had "assisted" at the battle from
the Paris side. In attempting to reach Versailles in
that direction, I found myself in the midst of the
insurgents, and under the fire of the troops. The
manner in which the insurgents behaved had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
given me a very exalted idea of their soldierly qualities.
It was all confusion, talking, drinking, and
panic. A mob of them surged up to the gate, and
demanded admission. It was refused, and they were
ordered back to their regiments. But the crowd increased,
and became more clamorous. The principles
of fraternity forbade the guard to keep their
brethren out in the cold, where the naughty Versaillais
might pounce upon them; so the draw-bridge
fell, the gates opened, and the runaways entered.</p>

<p>When I visited the battle-field, many of the dead
still lay unburied, while the soldiers lounged about
with their hands in those everlasting pockets, and
looking with the most perfect indifference upon
their dead countrymen. The class hatred which
exists in France is something we have no idea of,
and I trust that we never shall. It is bitter, relentless,
and cruel; and is, no doubt, a sad legacy of the
bloody Revolution of 1789, and of the centuries of
oppression which preceded it. At the beginning of
the war the peasants in one of the villages not far
from Paris thrust a young nobleman into a ditch,
and there burned him to death with the stubble
from the fields. They had nothing particular against
him, except that he was a nobleman. In Paris the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
mob threw the gendarmes, when they caught them,
into the Seine, and when they attempted to struggle
out upon the banks hacked off their hands. On the
battle-field I have referred to, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frères chrétiens</i>, a
most devoted and excellent body of men, were moving
about on their errands of mercy. Seeing these
unburied bodies, they went to the commanding officer,
and begged him to detail a party to bury them.
He did it to oblige them. As the soldiers lifted one
of the dead, a young American who accompanied me
said, "Why, he hasn't a bad face after all!" At once
the soldiers looked at him with suspicion, the officer
asked him who he was, and, upon being told, advised
him not to express any such sentiments again.</p>

<p>Our principal occupation at Versailles was keeping
a post-office for Americans in Paris. M. Rampont,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">directeur des postes</i>, had escaped, with all his
staff, and established the office at Versailles. The
archives of the bureau of the Avenue Joséphine
were placed in our Legation. The Communists were
angry enough to find themselves cut off from all
postal communication with the departments. It diminished
their chances of success. The only means
Americans had of communicating with their friends
in Paris was to send their letters to the care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Legation at Versailles. We have received as many
as fifty in one day. Two or three times a week we
took or sent them to Paris. They were there mailed
by the Legation, and distributed by the rebel post-office.
It cost Uncle Samuel a penny or two, but
he and his representatives at Washington did not
grumble.</p>

<p>The only episode of interest that occurred at Versailles
was our attempt to save the life of the Archbishop
of Paris. He had been arrested by the Commune,
and held as a hostage for the release of some
of their own rag, tag, and bobtail. One day the
Pope's Nuncio called to see Mr. Washburne. He
was in Paris. The Nonce thereupon explained his
business to me, and afterward sent two canons of the
Metropolitan Church to see me. They came to beg
Mr. Washburne to do all in his power to save the life
of the Archbishop, which they considered to be in imminent
danger. They had already tried one or more
European embassies, but were met with the answer
that they could have nothing to do with the Commune.
They handed me their papers, and I went at
once to Paris. Mr. Washburne took up the matter
with his accustomed energy and kindliness. He got
permission to see the prisoner. He took him books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and newspapers and old wine. He did all in his
power to negotiate an exchange with Blanqui, a veteran
agitator held by the Government. The Commune
consented, but the Versailles authorities would
not. M. Thiers consulted his ministers and his council
of deputies. They were unanimously of opinion
that they could hold no dealings with the Commune.
It was then proposed to let Blanqui escape, and that
thereupon the Archbishop should escape too, and
that there need be no negotiations whatever. This
M. Thiers declined.</p>

<p>Matters were complicated by the conduct of the
Vicar-general Lagarde. He had been a prisoner
with the Archbishop, and had been released for the
purpose of bringing letters to Versailles with a view
to negotiate the proposed exchange, and on condition
that he should return. Once safely at Versailles,
he declined to go back. His pretext was that
M. Thiers's letter in reply to the Archbishop's was
sealed, and that he could not carry back a sealed letter
in reply to one unsealed. I remember the sad
and resigned, but not bitter tone, in which the Archbishop
wrote of this desertion, and the exceedingly
cautious terms in which the Pope's Nuncio referred
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Washburne's untiring efforts were in vain.
He had to contend with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertia</i> of French
bureaucracy, and he who can move this mass must
be ten times a Hercules.</p>

<p>The Archbishop was murdered; but Blanqui,
whom the French Government held with so relentless
a grip, was condemned to a year or two's imprisonment
only.</p>

<p>I thought at that time, and think still, that no determined
effort was made to save the Archbishop's
life, except by two or three canons of his Church,
and by the Minister of the United States. The
French authorities certainly were lukewarm in the
matter. The Archbishop was a Gallican, a liberal
Catholic, notably so. Had he been an Ultramontane,
I think that the extreme Right of the Assembly&mdash;the
Legitimists&mdash;would have so exerted themselves
that his life would have been saved. M. Thiers occupied
a difficult position. He was suspected by the
Legitimists of coquetting with the radicals, and of
having no serious intention of putting down the insurrection.
The suspicion was, of course, unfounded;
but it may have prevented him from entering
upon those informal negotiations which would probably
have resulted in the release of the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>I once expressed these views to a lady in Paris,
herself a liberal Catholic. She would not admit
them to be true. Some weeks later, I met her again,
and she told me that she believed that I was right;
that she had heard such sentiments expressed by Legitimist
ladies, that she was satisfied that there was
an influential, if not a large, class of Ultramontanes, to
whom the death of the Archbishop was not unwelcome.
He has been succeeded by a noted Ultramontane.</p>

<p>Meantime the army was being rapidly reorganized.
The Imperial Guard, and other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d'élite</i>, had
returned from Germany, where they had been prisoners
of war. Marshal MacMahon took command.
Why M. Thiers did not then assault the city, and
carry it, as he undoubtedly could have done, was a
matter of surprise to every one, and especially to
those whose lives and property lay at the mercies of
the Commune. But Thiers had built the fortifications
of Paris. He looked upon them with a paternal
eye. To him they were not like other men's
fortifications. They were impregnable to ordinary
assault, and could only be taken by regular approaches.
How I wished that Guizot had built
them! We might have been saved a month of danger,
loss, and intense anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>On my weekly visit to Paris I had a better opportunity
to observe the progress of events than if I
had staid there without interruption, while my residence
of three days gave me ample occasion to appreciate
the full pleasures of the bombardment. It
must always be a mystery why the French bombarded
so persistently the quarter of the Arch of Triumph&mdash;the
West End of Paris&mdash;the quarter where
nine out of ten of the inhabitants were known friends
of the Government. They had their regular hours
for this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">divertissement</i>, for so they seemed to regard
it. They took a turn at it before breakfast, to give
them an appetite; and at five o'clock in the morning
I was waked by the shells from Mont Valérien
bursting and crashing in the Place de l'Etoile.
About noon they went at it again, and when I went
home to breakfast (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anglice</i> lunch), I had to dodge
round corners, and take refuge behind stone columns.
Then, just before sunset, they always favored
us with an evening gun, for good-night. The days,
too, were so confoundedly long at that season of the
year&mdash;April and May&mdash;and the weather provokingly
fine. How I longed for a delicious London
fog!</p>

<p>I remember one day, as I dodged behind a stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
pillar in the Rue de Presbourg to avoid a coming
shell, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i> called me in. I went into his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loge</i>, but declined to go into the cellar, where his wife
and children had taken refuge. He had two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loges</i>,
and I strongly advised him to move into the unoccupied
one as the safer of the two, for I had observed
that the shells generally passed easily enough through
one stone wall, but were arrested by a second. He
took my advice. The next day a shell from one of
their evening guns fell into the window of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loge</i>
he had left, passed through the floor into the cellar,
and there exploded, and tore every thing to pieces.</p>

<p>My own apartment was struck eight times by
fragments of shells. Fortunately but one exploded
in the house, and that two stories above me. It
shattered the room into which it fell fearfully, but,
strange to say, did no damage in the adjoining
rooms. Happily the apartment was unoccupied.
The tenants, a few days before, had taken advantage
of a law of the Commune which released all tenants
from their rent if they found it inconvenient to pay
it, and had decamped, furniture and all.</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne advised me to change my residence,
as it was not safe. But I felt that the dignity
of the great American people would not permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
even one of its subordinate representatives to leave
the building while a Frenchman remained in it.
Mr. Washburne's practice, too, was not in accordance
with his precepts. If we heard of any part of Paris
where shells were likely to burst and bullets to whistle,
Washburne was sure to have important business
in that direction.</p>

<p>I was not in my house when the shell exploded.
I generally came home to dinner after dark. If
there is any thing thoroughly disagreeable, it is to
have shells tumbling and bursting about you when
you are at dinner. It is bad enough at breakfast,
but the dinner-hour should be sacred from vulgar
intrusion.</p>

<p>I recollect one day after my midday breakfast, as
I left my house, I saw a knot of men standing on the
corner of the Avenue de l'Impératrice and the Rue
de Presbourg; I thought that I would go and see
what was up. Mont Valérien was blazing away at
a great rate. As I joined the group, one of them
said, "They'll fire at us soon, seeing half a dozen people
here." He had hardly said so, when there was
a flash, and a puff of smoke, and in a minute we
heard the huge shell hurtling through the air. It
missed us, of course, and fell in the Place, and ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>ploded.
All these men were friends of the Government,
and they were looking to Mont Valérien for
help, longing for the troops to come in. This was
the protection the Government gave its friends,
"the protection which the vulture gives the lamb,
covering and devouring it."</p>

<p>About once a week I was called in by some neighboring
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i> to note the damage done by shells
in apartments belonging to Americans. Shells are
strangely capricious. One end of No. 8 Rue de
Presbourg, opposite my own residence, was nearly
torn to pieces; the other end was untouched. At
No. 12, shell after shell penetrated the kitchen departments,
while the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i> were uninjured. I was
called to see the damage done to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier</i> of
No. 8, a beautiful apartment belonging to a New
York lady. A shell had entered the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> and exploded.
I have never seen more thorough destruction.
The mirrors were shattered; the floors and
ceilings rent and gaping; sofas, chairs, and tables upset
and broken. In the midst of all this destruction
stood a little table with a lady's work-basket upon it,
the needle in the work, the thimble and scissors on
the table, as if she had left them five minutes before&mdash;the
only objects unhurt in the room. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
touching souvenir of peaceful domestic life in the
midst of the worst ravages of war.</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne and Lord Lyons complained to
Jules Favre of this persistent bombardment, for the
property destroyed and the lives endangered were
largely American and English. He replied that it
was "bad shooting," but he smiled as he said so, and
evidently did not believe it himself. It was sheer
wantonness, that irrepressible desire of artillery-men,
of which I have before spoken, to hit something&mdash;an
enemy if possible, a friend if no enemy offers.</p>

<p>It was singular that while so many shells fell in
the immediate neighborhood of the Arch of Triumph,
so little serious injury was done to it. I remarked a
curious circumstance in this connection. The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'bass-reliefs'">bas-reliefs</ins>
on the arch facing the Avenue de la Grande
Armée are Peace and War&mdash;on the right, as you
face the Arch, War; on the left, Peace. War was
very much injured; Peace was scarcely touched.</p>

<p>As time passed, the puerilities and atrocities of
the Commune kept equal pace. They had taken possession
of the public buildings and raised the red
flag upon them, suppressing the tricolor. They now
passed a decree requiring every man to be provided
with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte d'identité</i>; this, they said, was to protect
them against Government spies. They established
a bureau of denunciation, where any man who
had a grudge against his neighbor had simply to denounce
him as a Versailles sympathizer, and he was
arrested. They closed the churches, or turned them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
into clubs. They arrested the priests; they shut
up some of the convents, and imprisoned the nuns.
They confiscated the gold and silver church plate,
and turned it into coin. It was emphatically a
"Reign of Terror." It was estimated that within
a month after the outbreak of the Commune three
hundred thousand people left Paris.</p>

<p>In the clubs they denounced the Legation. They
said that Mr. Washburne was about to call in the
Germans at the request of the diplomatic corps.
They proposed to hang him, and to banish the rest
of us. In point of fact, I believe that Mr. Washburne
could have called in the German army at any
time. He had only to report to General Manteuffel
that the lives of the Germans in Paris were in danger,
and that he found himself unable to protect
them, and Manteuffel would have occupied Paris at
once. But Mr. Washburne never entertained an
idea of doing this.</p>

<p>Then the Commune began to quarrel among
themselves. The Happy Family was at variance.
Strange as it may appear, at the beginning of the
affair, there were many earnest, honest fanatics in
Paris who joined the movement. The first demands
of the Commune under the influence of these men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
were not unreasonable, in American eyes. They
asked that they might elect their own prefect, and
that Paris should not be garrisoned by Government
soldiers. But events soon outstripped these men;
and as they found the city given over to organized
pillage&mdash;the Committee of Public Safety meeting in
secret, instead of in the light of open day, as they had
promised, and the model republic of which they had
dreamed as much a chimera as ever&mdash;they withdrew
from the Government. Over twenty of them withdrew
in a body, and published their reasons for doing
so. But the scoundrels who now directed the
movement "cared for none of these things." They
had used these poor enthusiasts while it suited their
purpose; now they threw them overboard, and replied
to their manifesto by removing the Committee
of Public Safety as too mild, afflicted with scruples,
and appointing one of a bloodier type, one of its
members a murderer.</p>

<p>During all this time the Legation was beset from
morning till night. The Alsacians and Lorrains residing
in Paris, whom the treaty had made Germans,
but who were nevertheless permitted to choose
their nationality, had fully intended to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opter</i> for
the French, and refused with indignation a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
nationality. But when they found that to remain
French condemned them to the National Guard,
while to become German enabled them to leave Paris,
and return to their homes, they came in shoals to
the Legation to ask for German passports. It was
a renewal of the days before the siege, the days of
the German expulsion. Much of Mr. Washburne's
time was taken up in visiting German prisoners, and
procuring their discharge, and sometimes that of
French priests and nuns. To procure the release of
Germans was no very difficult task, for the Commune,
as I have said, had a wholesome fear of the
Teuton, and "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civis Germanicus sum</i>" was an open-sesame
to Communist prison-doors. But to release
the poor French nuns was a more difficult task. Mr.
Washburne effected it in many instances; but it required
all his energy and decision.</p>

<p>And here I must remark how much better and
more humane it was to do as Mr. Washburne did&mdash;to
hold such communication with the officials of the
Commune as was absolutely necessary, and so save
human life, and mitigate human suffering&mdash;than to
sit with folded arms, and say, "Really, I can have
nothing to do with those people," and so let fellow-creatures
suffer and perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Where there is a will, there is generally a way.
Mr. Washburne was able to assist and protect indirectly
many persons whom he could not claim as
American citizens or German subjects. We could
not give a United States passport to a Frenchman,
but we could make him a bearer of dispatches, give
him a courier's pass, and so get him safely out of
Paris. Colonel Bonaparte escaped in this way. He
was on the "Black List" of the Commune for arrest,
and arrest then meant death.</p>

<p>As the siege progressed, the bombardment became
more and more severe. The beautiful avenue of
the Champs Elysées was like a city of the dead.
Not a living creature was to be seen upon it for
hours. From time to time a man would emerge
cautiously from a side street, gaze anxiously up the
avenue, then start on a run to cross it. But the
"insatiate thirst of gold" is stronger than the fear
of death; and, at the worst of the bombardment,
men and boys were to be seen lurking near the Arch,
and darting upon an exploding shell to secure its
fragments while they were still too hot to hold. A
large business was done in these fragments after the
siege, as well as in the unexploded shells. They
were sold as relics; and the Parisian shop-keepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
mounted them as clocks, fenders, inkstands, penholders,
and other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">articles de Paris</i>.</p>

<p>A battery of immense strength was at length
erected at Montretout, near St. Cloud. It was probably
the most powerful battery ever erected in the
world. It opened upon the gate of the Point du
Jour, and in a few days the scene of devastation in
that quarter was fearful. Not a house was left
standing, scarcely a wall. Bodies of soldiers of the
National Guard lay unburied among the ruins. The
fire was too hot for their comrades to approach
them.</p>

<p>In the mean time dissension reigned among the
Communists. A new Committee of Public Safety
was appointed. They arrested Cluseret, their Minister
of War, as they had already arrested Lullier.
They accused him of treason, and it would have
gone hard with him had the Commune continued
much longer in power. They said that "a hideous
plot had been discovered," but that the guilty were
known, and "their punishment should be exemplary
as their crime was unparalleled." They announced
that if the Commune fell, they would fire the city,
and its beauty and its pride should be buried with
them. They wrote forcibly, those fellows! Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
they fought with as much vigor as they wrote, the
world would at least have respected their courage,
instead of pronouncing them as cowardly as they
were cruel. But their career of crime and folly was
drawing to a close.</p>

<p>One day a citizen of Paris, a civil engineer, was
taking his afternoon walk. As he approached one
of the gates, not far from Auteuil, he was surprised
to find no National Guard on duty. He kept on,
and came to the fortifications. There was not a defender
in sight, while the French troops lay outside
under cover watching for some one to fire at. Why
they had not discovered the absence of the enemy
can only be accounted for by the general inefficiency
into which the French army had fallen. The
engineer raised his white handkerchief on his cane,
and when he saw that it was observed, quietly walked
through the ruins of the work, crossed the fosse,
and asked the officer in command why on earth he
did not come in; there was a gate, and no one to defend
it. It occurred to the officer that it might be
as well to do so; that perhaps that was what he was
there for: so he marched in with his company,
and Paris was taken. It was rather an anticlimax!
After a delay of months, and a fierce bombardment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to enter Paris on the invitation of a citizen taking
his afternoon walk! It was never known how that
gate came to be left unguarded. It was probably
owing to dissensions in the Commune. The battalion
holding it had not been relieved, as they expected
to be; so they voted that they would not stay
any longer, shouldered their muskets, and marched
off.</p>

<p>The troops entered on the 22d of May. Once
fairly in, the work was comparatively easy; but
they proceeded with great caution. It was said that
Gallifet urged that he should take his cavalry, and
scour the city. I believe that he could have done
it on that day, for the Communists were thoroughly
demoralized; but it was thought to be too hazardous
an operation for cavalry. The next morning the
troops advanced unopposed as far as the Place de la
Concorde. I have the word of an American friend,
whose apartment looked upon the Place, that the
strong barricade which connected the Rue St. Florentin
with the Tuileries Gardens was then undefended,
and that if the troops had advanced promptly
they could have carried it without resistance; but
while they sent forward their skirmishers, who found
no one to skirmish with, and advanced with the ut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>most
caution, a battery, followed by a battalion of
the National Guard, galloped up from the Hôtel de
Ville. The troops then began regular approaches.
They entered the adjoining houses, passing from
roof to roof, and occupying the upper windows, till
finally they commanded the barricade, and fired
down upon its defenders. They filled barrels with
sand, and rolled them toward the barrier. Each
barrel covered two skirmishers, who alternately rolled
the barrel and picked off the defenders of the barricade
if they ventured to show themselves. My informant
saw a young and apparently good-looking
woman spring upon the barricade, a red flag in her
hand, and wave it defiantly at the troops. She was
instantly shot dead. When the work was carried, an
old woman was led out to be shot. She was placed
with her back to the wall of the Tuileries Gardens,
and, as the firing party leveled their pieces, she put
her fingers to her nose, and worked them after the
manner of the defiant in all ages, or, as Dickens expresses
it, "as if she were grinding an imaginary
coffee-mill."</p>

<p>Many of their strongest positions were abandoned
by the insurgents, having been turned by the troops.
Those that resisted fell one after the other, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
in the way I have described. Indeed, I can see no
possibility of a barricade holding out unless the adjacent
houses are held too. That at the head of the
Rue St. Florentin was of great strength, a regular
work; for the Communists had several excellent
engineers in their ranks, graduates of the military
schools, men who had been disappointed under the
Government in not meeting with the promotion
they thought they deserved, and so joined the Commune.
The ditch of the barricade St. Florentin was
about sixteen feet deep. It made a convenient burying-ground.
The dead Communists, men and women,
were huddled into it, quicklime added, and the
fosse filled up. As the pleasure-seeker enters the
Rue de Rivoli from the Place de la Concorde he
passes over the bodies of forty or fifty miserable
wretches&mdash;most of them scoundrels of the deepest
dye&mdash;but among them some wild fanatics, and some
poor victims of the Commune, forced unwillingly
into its ranks.</p>

<p>Much must be pardoned to soldiers heated with
battle, and taught to believe every prisoner they
take an incarnate devil. But making all allowances,
there is no excuse for the wholesale butcheries committed
by the troops. A friend of mine saw a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
in the Boulevard Malesherbes visited by a squad of
soldiers. They asked the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i> if there were
any Communists concealed there. She answered
that there were none. They searched the house, and
found one. They took him out and shot him, and
then shot her. One of the attachés of the Legation
saw in the Avenue d'Autin the bodies of six children,
the eldest apparently not over fourteen, shot to
death as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétroleuses</i>, suspected of carrying petroleum
to fire the houses. There was no trial of any
kind, no drum-head court-martial even, such as the
laws of civilized warfare require under all circumstances.
Any lieutenant ordered prisoners to be
shot as the fancy took him, and no questions were
asked. Many an innocent spectator perished in
those days. An English officer had a narrow escape.
He approached a crowd of prisoners halted for a
moment on the Champs Elysées; and when they
moved on, the guard roped him in with the rest, and
would not listen to a word of explanation. Happily
he was able to attract the attention of the Marquis
de Gallifet and explain his position. An officer of
high rank who was escorting a batch of prisoners to
Versailles is said to have halted in the Bois, ridden
down the column, picked out those whose faces he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
particularly disliked, and had them shot on the spot.
The number of lives taken after the defeat of the
Commune can never be accurately known; but it
was generally computed at the time to exceed the
number of those lost in both sieges.</p>

<p>Petroleum next became the madness of the hour.
Every woman carrying a bottle was suspected of being
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétroleuse</i>. The most absurd stories were told
of its destructive properties. Organized bands of
women were said to be patrolling the streets armed
with bottles of petroleum. This they threw into the
cellar windows, and then set fire to it. The windows
were barred, and the cellars in Paris are universally
built in stone and concrete. How they effected
their purpose under these circumstances is not
readily seen. If this was their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i>, they
were the most inexpert incendiaries ever known.
The Commune should blush for its pupils in crime.
I do not believe in the petroleum story, and I do not
think that one-third of the population believed in it.
Yet such was the power of suspicion in those days,
and such the distrust of one's neighbor, that every
staid and sober housekeeper bricked up his cellar
windows, and for weeks in the beautiful summer
weather not an open window was to be seen on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
lower stories. No doubt every second man thought
it a great piece of folly thus to shut out light and
air from his lower stories; but if he had not done
as his neighbors did, he would have been denounced
by them as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétroleux</i>.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Commune, as I have said, had
sworn that, if the city were taken, they would blow
up the public buildings, and bury every thing in a
common ruin. Happily, their good-will exceeded
their ability. They had no time to execute their
atrocious projects. They burned the Tuileries, the
Finances, the Hôtel de Ville, the Comptes, the Hotel
of the Legion of Honor, and a small portion of
the Palais Royal. The only irreparable loss was
that of the Hôtel de Ville. The Finances, the
Comptes, and the Legion of Honor had no imperishable
historical associations connected with them.
The Tuileries was an old and inconvenient building.
The Emperor had already rebuilt it in part. Plans
for reconstructing the whole building had been prepared
and still exist, and nothing but the want of
money had prevented their being carried into execution
long before.</p>

<p>I do not propose to dwell upon the horrors of the
nights of the 23d and 24th of May, when all Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
appeared to be in flames. The view from the high
ground upon which the Legation stands was very
striking. A pall of smoke hung over the city by
day, and pillars of fire lighted it by night. One of
the most painful features of those days was the prolonged
suspense. We did not know which of the
magnificent monuments of Paris were in flames; for
the troops permitted no approach, and the most
startling rumors were current. The Louvre was at
one time in danger, but happily escaped.</p>

<p>I pass over, too, the cruelties of the march of the
prisoners to Versailles, and the sufferings they there
endured. These things are written in the annals
of the times, and no good can be done by reviving
them. Beautiful France has been sorely tried with
revolutions. Let us hope that she has seen the last.</p>

<p>In the hotel of the German Embassy at Paris may
be seen several articles of value, mostly Sèvres and
Dresden china, which the German Government desires
to present to Mr. Washburne, General Read,
and some few other officers of the United States, in
token of its gratitude for services rendered to German
subjects during the war. These articles can not
be received without the permission of Congress.
The House promptly passed the joint resolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
The Senate still hesitates. Mr. Fox, formerly Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, and the officers who accompanied
him to Russia, were permitted to receive
such presents as "the Emperor might see fit to
give them." Are Mr. Washburne and his subordinates,
who certainly rendered some services, and
suffered some hardships, less entitled to receive this
permission than Mr. Fox and his companions, who
took a monitor to Cronstadt?</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
